Report plan:
- chemically peculiar stars
- map EB uniquely 
- what is starry how does it work
- the fitted maps have residuals
 - what do they tell us? 
- future efforts: mcmc

Coding:
 - add axvlines of harmonics of rotation period to the fourier of residuals. i.e. plot an axvline for each integer multiple of the rotational period frequency
 - generate a nice pdf of the surface map

Presentation: 
 - create the slide!
 - generate diagrams for slide
 	- visual diagrams of eclipses overlaid on flux curve
