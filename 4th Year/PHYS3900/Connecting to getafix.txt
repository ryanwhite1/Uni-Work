Once connected to UQ vpn, in Windows powershell, run:

ssh uqrwhi13@getafix.smp.uq.edu.au

then enter UQ staff password when prompted. This will put you in the /home/ directory. 


### Move file from Local Machine to Getafix ###
In powershell, as an example, I ran the following code (on a powershell prompt on the local machine, in the directory "C:\Users\ryanw")

scp -3 "Desktop/Uni-Work/4th Year/PHYS3900/test.txt" uqrwhi13@getafix.smp.uq.edu.au:/home/uqrwhi13/PHYS3900

To merge the local directory with the getafix directory, run (in the same directory as before):

scp -3 "Desktop/Uni-Work/4th Year/PHYS3900/Getafix Resources/" uqrwhi13@getafix.smp.uq.edu.au:/home/uqrwhi13/PHYS3900

Since it's going from a Windows to Unix machine, need to run the following on any bash script:

cat DIHerTestBash.sh | dos2unix >DIHerTestBashRun.sh

as an example



### First Time Setup ###
To install anaconda, I ran (in the home/uqrwhi13/ directory),

wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2022.05-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Anaconda3-2022.05-Linux-x86_64.sh

Then followed the prompts to install.
