The files Q1.py and Q2.py were programmed in Python 3.9.12 (although should work for most 3.x installations) and need reasonably up-to-date matplotlib, numpy and scipy packages installed. 

These files are easily runnable with an installation of Anaconda and Spyder, where you can open the file in Spyder and run it (either with Shift+Enter, or with the green button at the top) to produce and save all figures and produce numerical output used in the report.
