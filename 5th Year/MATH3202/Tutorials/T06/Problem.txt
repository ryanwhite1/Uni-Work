Problem
-------


Sets
----
J 				- flavour of juices made
G subset of J 	- gourmet juices
F 				- set of constituent fruits (ingredients) [assume 0 is FCOJ]
T 				- set of time periods (quarters)


Data
----
P_{jt} 	- predicted (forecast) sales of each juice flavour for each quarter
C_f 	- cost per component juice ($/kL)
S 		- Sale price of juice  ($/L) [all flavours sell for same price]
b_{jf} 	- amount of constituent juice in each flavour
FCOJ_t 	- limit on FCOJ imported in quarter t


Variables
---------
X_{jt} - amount of each juice to make each quarter
Y_{ft} - integer number of truckloads of fruit f (>0) purchased in quarter t
Z_{gt} - set to 1 if gourmet juice g is produced in quarter t, 0 otherwise


Objective
---------
maximise profit = sales - costs

max SUM_{jt} (S * X_{jt}  -  C_0 * b_{j0} * X_{jt} - SUM_{f>0} C_f * 10 * Y_{ft})


Constraints
-----------

Limit on FCOJ: 				SUM_{j} b_{j0} * x_{jt} <= FCOL_t 		for all t in T
Limit on fruit used: 		SUM_{j} b_{jf} * X_{jt} <= 10 * Y_{ft} 	for all f in F, t in T
Gourmet juice constraint: 	SUM_{g} Z_{gt} <= 2						for all t in T
Limit on demand:			X_{jt} <= P_{jt} 						for all j in J, t in T
Limit on gourmet demand:	X_{jt} <= P_{jt} * Z_{jt} 				for all j in G, t in T
Non-zero constraint: 		X_{jt} >= 0 							for all j in J, t in T
