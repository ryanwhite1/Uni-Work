Sets
----
N 				- Nodes
S subset of N 	- Supplier Nodes 
E 				- Edges (pipes that link nodes)
T				- Forecasted demand period (time)
O 				- Options for upgrades (0th option is no upgrade)
F 				- Forecasts for demand in 10 years

Data
----
l_e			- Length of edge e in E														(km)
d_{nt}		- Forecast gas demand for node n in N at time t in T						(MJ)
c_s 		- cost per unit gas from supplier s in S 									($/MJ)
SC_s 		- Maximum supply (supplying capacity) of supplier s in S over one day 		(MJ)
f_e, t_e 	- "From" and "to" nodes of each edge e in E 
SU_{os}		- Supply upgrade for option o in O for supplying node s in S 				(MJ)
UC_{os} 	- Upgrade cost for option o in O for supplying node s in S 					($)
Pmax 		- Maximum capacity of pipeline 												(MJ)
Pcost		- Pipeline upgrade cost per kilometer										($/km)
CMult_t		- Cost multiplier for t in T (equal to the list [1, 0.7])
DMult_tf	- Demand forecast multiplier for t in T for f in F = [[1, 1, 1], [0.8, 1, 1.2]]



Variables
---------
X_{ntf}		- gas supplied by supplier n in N at time t in T for scenario f in F								(continuous)
Y_{etf}		- net gas transmission along edge e in E at time t in T for scenario f in F 						(continuous)
W_{ostf}	- 1 if using upgrade o in O for supplier s in S at time t in T for scenario f in F, 0 otherwise 	(binary)
P_{etf}		- 1 if duplicating pipeline e in E at time t in T for scenario f in F, otherwise 0  				(binary)




Objective
---------
min SUM_f 1/3 * ([SUM_{o s t} CMult_t * UC_{os} * W_{ostf}] + [SUM_{e t} CMult_t * P_{etf} * l_e * Pcost])





Constraints
-----------
Supply constraints: 			X_{stf} <= SC_{s} + SUM_{o, j<=t} (W_{osjf} * SU_{os})											for all s in S, t in T , f in F
								X_{ntf} <= 0																					for all n in N \ S, t in T, f in F
Flow constraint:				X_{ntf} + SUM_{e s.t. t_e == n} Y_{etf} == SUM_{e s.t. f_e == n} Y_{etf} + DMult_tf * d_{nt}	for all n in N, t in T, f in F
Unique upgrade constraint: 		SUM_{o t} W_{ostf} == 1																			for all s in S, f in F
Pipeline upgrade constraints:	Y_{etf} <= Pmax * (1 + SUM_{j<=t}[P_{ejf}])														for all e in E, t in T, f in F
								SUM_t P_{etf} <= 1																				for all e in E, f in F	
5-Year Upgrade constraints: 	SUM_f P_{e0f} == len(F) * P_{e00}																for all e in E						(this constraint makes all upgrades across F the same over the first 5 years)
								SUM_{of} W_{os0f} == len(F) * SUM_o W_{os00}													for all s in S 						(analogous constraint to the one above)
5-vs-10 Year Upgrade Constr:	SUM_{os} W_{os1f} * UC_{os} + SUM_e P_{e1f} * l_e * Pcost
								<= 2 * (SUM_{os} W_{os0f} * UC_{os} + SUM_e P_{e0f} * l_e * Pcost)								for all f in F
