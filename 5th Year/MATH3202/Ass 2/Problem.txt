Sets
----
N 				- Nodes
S subset of N 	- Supplier Nodes 
E 				- Edges (pipes that link nodes)
T				- Forecasted demand period (time)
O 				- Options for upgrades (0th option is no upgrade)

Data
----
l_e			- Length of edge e in E														(km)
d_{nt}		- Forecast gas demand for node n in N at time t in T						(MJ)
c_s 		- cost per unit gas from supplier s in S 									($/MJ)
SC_s 		- Maximum supply (supplying capacity) of supplier s in S over one day 		(MJ)
f_e, t_e 	- "From" and "to" nodes of each edge e in E 
SU_{os}		- Supply upgrade for option o in O for supplying node s in S 				(MJ)
UC_{os} 	- Upgrade cost for option o in O for supplying node s in S 					($)
Pmax 		- Maximum capacity of pipeline 												(MJ)
Pcost		- Pipeline upgrade cost per kilometer										($/km)
CMult_t		- Cost multiplier for t in T (equal to the list [1, 0.7])



Variables
---------
X_{nt}		- gas supplied by supplier n in N at time t in T 								(continuous)
Y_{et}		- net gas transmission along edge e in E at time t in T 						(continuous)
W_{ost}		- 1 if using upgrade o in O for supplier s in S at time t in T, 0 otherwise 	(binary)
P_{et}		- 1 if duplicating pipeline e in E at time t in T, otherwise 0 					(binary)




Objective
---------
min ([SUM_{o s t} CMult_t * UC_{os} * W_{ost}] + [SUM_{e t} CMult_t * P_{et} * l_e * Pcost])





Constraints
-----------
Supply constraints: 			X_{st} <= SC_{s} + SUM_{o, j<=t} (W_{osj} * SU_{os})							for all s in S, t in T 
								X_{nt} <= 0																		for all n in N \ S, t in T
Flow constraint:				X_{nt} + SUM_{e s.t. t_e == n} Y_{et} == SUM_{e s.t. f_e == n} Y_{et} + d_{nt}	for all n in N, t in T
Unique upgrade constraint: 		SUM_{o t} W_{ost} == 1															for all s in S
Pipeline upgrade constraints:	Y_{et} <= Pmax * (1 + SUM_{j<=t}[P_{ej}])										for all e in E, t in T
								SUM_t P_{et} <= 1																for all e in E
