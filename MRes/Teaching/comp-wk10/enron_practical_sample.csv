subject : re : tax reserve on allegheny peakers
the reserve referred to relates to sales and use tax ( "" sales / use tax "" ) liability related to the purchase and use by the peaker project companies of various equipment ( i . e . , turbines in illinois and transformers in tennessee and indiana ) used to construct the peaker facilities in illinois , indiana and tennessee . enron bears this tax obligation under the sales agreement pursuant to which we sold the peakers to allegheny ( effectively , this tax liability is a "" pre - acquisition date "" tax liability that we , as the seller , are responsible for ) . typically , the equipment used to construct the peakers would be assessed sales / use tax when purchased by the project company that built the respective peaker and that tax would effectively be passed on to the buyer in a sale such as that to allegheny . the ews tax department structured the acquisition of the respective equipment to either avoid the sales / use tax or to spread the cost of such tax over time ( for example , a sales - leaseback strategy was employed in illinois to spread the cost of the sales / use tax over many years as lease payments are made rather than pay it up front ) . ultimately , we benefitted from this since we did not use as much cash in constructing the peakers and earned more from the disposition of the peakers than we otherwise would have since the counterparty would have ( and we believe did in the specific case of allegheny ) modelled the cost of the peakers as including the full current payment of such sales / use tax . that said , we have requested that a portion of the disposition proceeds from the sale of the peakers be reserved until the applicable statute of limitations related to the types of strategies that were employed to achieve the above described results expires since there is risk that our position could be challenged and , if challenged , there is a risk that we would not prevail . matt is out until may 8 ( he is a recent father of a baby girl ) but upon his return is available with me to discuss this matter with whomever you would like . matt has worked closely with don and others in the generation asset group and has assured me that the suggested reserve is a sound ( not overly conservative nor liberal ) position . best regards . steve .

enron corp . reduced its previously reported net income dating back to 1997 by $ 586 million , or 20 % , mostly due to improperly accounting for its dealings with partnerships run by some company officers .
the disclosure , contained in a securities and exchange commission filing , came even as the houston energy - trading company continued its merger talks with rival dynegy inc . dynegy , an independent power producer and utility owner , is looking at acquiring enron for roughly $ 7 billion to $ 8 billion , people familiar with the talks say . however , those talks could also be influenced by whether enron is further downgraded by major credit - ratings agencies .
the total price being discussed would equate to about $ 10 an enron share , barely above where the stock is currently trading and far below the level of even two weeks ago . as of 4 p . m . in new york stock exchange composite trading yesterday , enron shares were down 7 . 1 % , or 64 cents , to $ 8 . 41 , a tenth of their 52 - week high of $ 84 . 875 .
on the big board , dynegy traded at $ 36 . 50 , up $ 3 . 50 . shares of several energy - trading companies were up yesterday following a directive from federal regulators that the california state government pay an estimated $ 1 . 6 billion for past power purchases .
in yesterday ' s sec filing , enron also made major adjustments in its reported assets , debt and shareholder equity back to 1997 . for instance , for the three - month period ended sept . 30 , enron lopped about $ 2 . 2 billion , or 19 % , off shareholder equity , reducing it to a total of $ 9 . 5 billion . previously , the company had disclosed a reduction of only $ 1 . 2 billion .
the filing also said that enron discharged ben glisan , the company treasurer , and kristina mordaunt , the general counsel of enron ' s north america unit , in connection with investments they made in one of the officer - run limited partnerships . until yesterday , enron had insisted that mr . glisan wasn ' t associated with the officer - run partnerships . the company wouldn ' t explain why the the two had been discharged , and mr . glisan and ms . mordaunt couldn ' t be reached to comment .
the sec filing is the latest chapter in a crisis that has engulfed the nation ' s biggest energy - trading company during the past month . during that time , enron has reported a big third - quarter loss , the replacement of its chief financial officer who ran two of the controversial partnerships , and an sec investigation .
the sec filing raises further questions about enron ' s accounting procedures and disclosure policies . concerns over these matters are vexing investors and analysts , including those at major credit - rating agencies . the agencies downgraded enron debt during recent weeks and have the company on review for further downgrades .
ralph pellecchia , credit analyst for fitch , said he couldn ' t predict what effect the sec filing would have on enron ' s credit rating , but he added that the document contained damaging disclosures . "" it ' s bad , "" he said .
the enron sec filing also raises questions about the conduct of its outside auditor , arthur andersen llp , which reviewed the company ' s annual financial statements and certified them as consistent with accepted accounting principals . because of all the accounting adjustments "" the audit reports covering the year - end financial statements for 1997 - 2000 should not be relied upon , "" yesterday ' s sec filing said .
an andersen spokesman called enron ' s restatement announcement "" an unfortunate situation "" but said the accounting firm is "" cooperating with the company . . . to bring resolution to these matters . "" he said he couldn ' t comment further because of client - confidentiality concerns .
among the accounting turnabouts , enron said it had improperly accounted for two partnerships connected to michael
kopper , a former managing director of the company ' s north america unit . the two partnerships were known as joint energy development investments lp , or jedi , and chewco investments lp .
as reported , mr . kopper managed the general partner of chewco , which was formed in 1997 . jedi had been formed in 1993 by enron in partnership with the huge california public employees ' retirement system , or calpers .
in 1997 enron , which operated jedi , bought out calpers ' interest for $ 383 million and immediately sold it to chewco , according to the sec filing . almost all the money for chewco ' s purchase came in loans from jedi and an unnamed financial institution , whose loan was guaranteed by enron .
by having a supposed outside party in the form of chewco as a partner , enron treated jedi as an unconsolidated affiliate and kept hundreds of millions of dollars of partnership debt off its balance sheet . enron now acknowledges that treatment was wrong and that both jedi and chewco should have been consolidated starting in 1997 . taking that step retroactively resulted in a $ 396 million reduction in net income for the years 1997 to 2000 , the sec filing said .
mr . kopper , who left enron in july to run the partnerships , didn ' t return a phone call seeking comment . in the past , he has declined to be interviewed .
enron also retroactively consolidated some of the results of its dealings with a partnership called ljm cayman lp . that consolidation reduced 1999 and 2000 net income by $ 103 million .
ljm and a similar but much larger partnership , called ljm 2 co - investment lp , were formed in 1999 by enron ' s then - chief financial officer andrew fastow , who was replaced last month . the two partnerships were run by mr . fastow and mr . kopper , according to the enron sec filing and private partnership documents . enron ' s sec filing said the company believes that mr . fastow sold his interests in the ljm partnerships in july to mr . kopper . mr . fastow has declined to be interviewed .
several analysts said they were troubled that none of the earnings restatements were directly attributed to the much larger ljm 2 partnership . some also pointed to a sentence in the sec filing that said "" it is possible "" that continuing enron reviews will "" identify additional or different information concerning these matters .

does enron trust its new numbers ? it doesn ' t act like it

you ' d be better informed if , instead of listening to what we say , you watch what we do . ' '
that excellent advice was not issued by enron management , although it should have been . instead it came more than 30 years ago from john n . mitchell , president richard m . nixon ' s attorney general .
enron ' s restatement of earnings yesterday did not go far enough to allow investors to understand all of what went on during the company ' s many strange transactions with related parties . it is now consolidating the results of some of its off - balance - sheet creations , though what happened in the most important ones remains a mystery .
but the restatement should , at the least , cause investors and wall street analysts to realize they have been fooled by so - called pro forma earnings , which leave out unpleasant realities and ignore accounting rules .
in january , enron told investors its ' ' recurring net income , ' ' as it calls its pro forma number , would be $ 1 . 70 to $ 1 . 75 a share this year . the company ' s share price rose to $ 82 when that forecast was made .
remarkably , enron is still on course to hit that target . yesterday ' s restatement raised its nine - month earnings figure by a penny , to $ 1 . 36 . and yet enron appears to be willing to sell out for about $ 10 a share , or less than six times its reported profits , which still appear to be growing . why so little ?
the answer may be that enron ' s board knows those numbers are not reliable measures of performance . enron ' s failure to disclose more about the still unconsolidated subsidiaries is an indication that the unreleased facts would not be reassuring . and enron cannot stay in business unless customers and investors believe it is financially solid . so it is willing to sell out for a fraction of what it appeared to be worth only weeks ago . don ' t call it a takeover . takeunder would be a better term .
what set off enron ' s collapse ? it now appears to have been a mistake . enron says it added $ 1 billion to shareholder equity in 2000 and early this year in error . the mistake did nothing to improve enron ' s profits at the time , so it seems unlikely it was deliberate . had the mistake not been made , the reduction in shareholder equity it disclosed last month would have been $ 200 million , not $ 1 . 2 billion . that reduction scared investors into believing that enron ' s transactions with partnerships led by andrew fastow , its former chief financial officer , had been disastrous for the company . now it appears they may not have been so bad .
but that fact is not very important now . enron ' s new disclosures indicate that perhaps 40 percent of its reported profits in 2000 came from dealings with the fastow partnerships . such profits may be legal under accounting rules , but there are good reasons to doubt how real they are .
in fact , the accounting rule makers are even now pondering a question that may be important to enron . the body charged with dealing with new accounting issues got a rush question on oct . 23 - - the day before enron ousted mr . fastow - - about the accounting on transactions at a hypothetical ' ' big energy corporation ' ' where one subsidiary , a natural gas pipeline company , trades with another subsidiary , an energy trading entity . the question posed was whether a company can report profits made by one subsidiary while ignoring the losses of the other one . that company may or may not be enron .
such games will not work anymore , at least for enron . it needs to be acquired because its customers are not willing to believe even its revised numbers .

surest steps , not the swiftest , are propelling dynegy past enron

the tortoise appears ready to overtake the hare .
until they confirmed yesterday that they were in merger talks , the enron corporation and dynegy inc . were rivals within the new , rapidly evolving deregulated power industry . each embodied a sharply different approach to making money , attracting investors and winning over regulators .
enron thrived on risk , hurling itself into projects and businesses largely untested by others , earning along the way a reputation for innovation and the acclaim of the investors and analysts who now so angrily shun it because of its murky accounting .
dynegy is the slower , more cautious company , the younger sibling that carefully gleaned lessons from the example set by a brasher enron . dynegy ' s steady progress has now made it strong and solvent enough to contemplate a multibillion - dollar takeover of its erstwhile competitor .
as one senior energy industry executive said , ' ' enron ' s trying to hit more triples and home runs , while dynegy tries for singles and doubles . ' '
kenneth lay , the enron chairman and chief executive who built an empire from two troubled gas pipeline companies - - and whose influential friends include president bush - - is the one who points to the bleachers . dynegy ' s chairman and chief executive , charles l . watson , is less well known but is well respected among stock analysts . he also started small , nurturing his energy trading and generating company - - which had $ 33 billion in revenue for the nine months ended sept . 30 - - from a natural gas trading concern he began in the mid - 80 ' s .
when electricity markets around the united states were deregulated , the companies followed clearly divergent paths . utilities no longer necessarily generated power , and they and their larger industrial clients looked for good deals on the power being sold on the new wholesale markets for electricity . enron and dynegy traded and marketed energy . yet enron sold most of the power plants it owned and focused mainly on financial transactions rather than the actual physical delivery of power , a strategy that made the company a lot of money very fast .
dynegy bought power plants instead and focused on being a reliable supplier of energy . it cashed in , too , on deregulation , but not as enron had . it stuck to its core energy business as its archrival branched into overseas operations , retail power marketing , a water business and a broadband venture , most of which have gone badly awry .
mr . watson said in an interview earlier this year that a string of power plant acquisitions had kept his company diversified and balanced . ' ' we need a little bit everywhere , ' ' he said . ' ' enron is a financial player , but dynegy is more of a physical player . ' '
if enron ' s finances grew more confusing , dynegy seemed to offer clarity . if enron promised a lot , analysts said , dynegy played up its accomplishments . enron lobbied regulators and politicians very publicly , while dynegy kept things quiet and discreet .
' ' chuck watson is a pretty straight - talking guy , ' ' said christopher r . ellinghaus , a williams capital group analyst .
because enron had such extravagant earnings promises to fulfill , some analysts said , it may have been tempted to hide its problems and losses with creative accounting . while dynegy avoided such a path , no one really expects mr . watson to gloat about his company ' s new , larger stature . enron may have been less a hare than a canary in the deregulation coal mine , and it is unclear who will take on that role now .
' ' dynegy had what could be called a second - mover advantage , ' ' said andre meade , head of commerzbank securities ' united states utility research . ' ' it seemed to be content to watch its larger rival up the street in houston , enron , go into a market . and if it was successful , dynegy then could go in with less money and make it work . ' '

enron admits to overstating profits by about $ 600 million

the enron corporation yesterday sliced more than half a billion dollars from its reported profits over the last five years , but its crosstown rival , dynegy inc . , still appeared to be willing to acquire enron , executives close to the merger talks said .
worries about how bond rating agencies would react to the merger delayed announcement of the deal , the executives said . but the failure to announce a deal - - as well as the profit restatement - - caused enron ' s share price to fall . and volume in its core north american natural gas and electricity trading operation plunged 20 percent as other energy - trading companies , unnerved by enron ' s financial distress , steered business elsewhere .
the boards of the two companies tentatively agreed late wednesday night to a deal in which dynegy would acquire enron for about $ 8 billion in stock , or roughly $ 10 a share .
the deal would include an initial $ 1 . 5 billion cash infusion from chevrontexaco , which owns 27 percent of dynegy , and later an additional infusion of $ 1 billion .
the sticking point to proceeding with the deal , according to the executives , is whether enron ' s credit rating will be reduced to ' ' junk ' ' status by the major credit rating agencies in reaction to enron ' s disclosures and its plan to be acquired by dynegy .
dynegy and enron have provided pro forma statements of what a combined dynegy - enron would look like and asked standard & poor ' s and moody ' s investors service for an ' ' expedited review ' ' of the transaction .
dynegy and chevrontexaco are also privately considering whether to offer a bigger cash infusion to buoy enron ' s credit rating - - now just two notches from falling below investment grade - - if the agencies look askance at the current deal . the companies are hoping for a response within the next day or two , the executives said .
the executives also said dynegy was seeking further protections that would allow it to back out of the deal if new , adverse disclosures surfaced .
shares of dynegy rose sharply yesterday , although it was not clear whether buyers believed that the company - - one - quarter the size of enron , in terms of revenues - - was getting a bargain or that enron ' s latest disclosures would lead to the deal ' s being abandoned . dynegy rose $ 3 . 50 , or 10 . 6 percent , to $ 36 . 50 , gaining back all of the ground lost on wednesday after news of the deal leaked . enron shares fell 64 cents , or 7 . 1 percent , to $ 8 . 41 . less than a year ago , enron traded for more than $ 84 a share , and the company was valued at nearly $ 70 billion .
in a sweeping restatement of its profits , enron said that its actual net income for the years 1997 to 2000 was $ 591 million less than it had reported on its financial statements . in a filing with the s . e . c . , enron also indicated that part of last year ' s reported profits came from transactions with partnerships controlled by andrew s . fastow , who was the company ' s chief financial officer until he was ousted oct . 24 .
enron said the transactions involving mr . fastow , which are part of the s . e . c . investigation , earned the former executive more than $ 30 million . the company also said it had fired its treasurer and the general counsel of one of its divisions , who both had invested in one of the partnerships .
any deal would also face long and complex reviews by federal and state energy regulators , who would have to sort out a range of competitive issues in the still - young business of wholesale natural gas and electricity trading . among the agencies involved would be the federal energy regulatory commission , the federal trade commission and the justice department .
some analysts expressed hope that enron ' s financial straits would encourage regulators to clear any deal , to relieve government officials of the prospect of dealing with the potential collapse of the nation ' s dominant energy - trading company . enron handles about a quarter of all power trading , and higher proportions in some important regional markets .
' ' if not for the dire condition of enron today , we are not certain an enron - dynegy merger would be possible due to antitrust concerns , ' ' said christopher r . ellinghaus , an analyst at williams capital . ' ' however , the effective industry bailout that the merger would represent would probably lead to some leniency from the f . t . c . , and would probably be looked at with some relief by the f . e . r . c . ' '
it was clear yesterday there would be opposition to the deal . ' ' if dynegy and enron were to get together , obviously the thing that would appeal to dynegy would be to combine the trading function of the two entities , and that in itself would provide greater market power , not less market power , ' ' said raymond plank , chairman of the apache corporation , one of the largest independent natural gas producers , based in houston .
mr . plank said he hoped regulators would take a critical look at any deal . ' ' the thing they should take a look at is the concentration of market power that has led to excessive volatility , and as a result , once again is threatening north american gas producers . ' '
enron ' s restated profits almost wiped out its net income in 1997 , and reduced it for every year since . but the changes actually raised its reported profits so far this year by $ 5 million .
the changes came largely from including results of two special purpose partnerships that it had treated as being independent - - companies called jedi and chewco , after characters in the ' ' star wars ' ' movies - - and of including a subsidiary of a partnership called ljml . that partnership , and another called ljm 2 , were run by mr . fastow .
the remainder of the earnings reductions , totaling $ 92 million from 1997 through 2000 , came from what enron called ' ' prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications , ' ' which appear to have been changes previously recommended by arthur andersen , enron ' s auditors , but not made because the auditors were persuaded the amounts were immaterial . details of those charges were not disclosed , and enron said it might further alter its reporting as a special board committee continues its investigation of the partnership transactions .
' ' this is an unfortunate situation , ' ' said david tabolt , a spokesman for arthur andersen , which audited enron ' s books in all the years in question . ' ' issues have surfaced that have caused the company to restate its financial statements and advise investors that they should not rely on enron ' s financial statements or our audit reports . we are cooperating with the company and its special committee to bring resolution to these matters . ' '
while the restated financial statements consolidated the results of two partnerships and the ljml subsidiary , they did not fold the entire ljml partnership or the ljm 2 partnership into enron ' s financials . it is not clear how those partnerships performed . nor did they include some other related entities whose enron - guaranteed debts have aroused concern among investors .
mr . fastow , enron ' s former chief financial officer , could not be reached for comment , his lawyer said .
enron ' s downward cascade began after it reported third - quarter earnings on oct . 16 . its share price rose 67 cents , to $ 33 . 84 , that day , as the company said its ' ' recurring net income ' ' had met analyst expectations , even though write - offs led to a net loss .
in a conference call that day , kenneth l . lay , enron ' s chairman , mentioned that the company had written down shareholder equity by $ 1 . 2 billion as it closed out its relationships with the ljm partnerships . in the following days , that figure became widely discussed as some investors concluded that the company had suffered a large loss that it was able to avoid reporting on the earnings statement .
but enron said yesterday that reduction should have been only $ 200 million , with the remaining $ 1 billion reduction simply reversing prior errors made in 2000 and early this year .
enron said it had set up procedures to monitor transactions with the ljm partnerships and assure they were proper . ' ' whether these controls were properly implemented ' ' is being investigated by the special board committee , the company said . that committee has retained william mclucas , a former director of enforcement for the s . e . c . , as well as accountants from deloitte kristina mordaunt , the general counsel of an enron division ; and kathy lynn , vice president of an enron division . the company said ms . lynn no longer worked for enron and that the company was ' ' terminating the employment ' ' of the other two .
some industry officials said yesterday that a deal with dynegy was increasingly looking like a do - or - die prospect for enron , as other energy - trading companies began to back away from the company and take their business to other trading companies . while enron has a large network of natural gas pipelines and other profitable assets , by far its most valuable franchise is its energy - trading business in north america , which acts as an intermediary in more gas and electricity trades than any other company .
yesterday , volume in that business dropped 20 percent . an enron spokesman said company traders attributed the drop to concerns about the s . e . c . investigation and the outcome of the merger talks with dynegy .
enron also canceled a planned meeting with its creditors today in houston , executives said . the agenda for the meeting had been an extension of its $ 3 billion credit lines , but the merger talks superseded that discussion .

houston , nov . 9 ( bloomberg ) - - dynegy inc . ' s plan to buy
rival energy trader enron corp . has stalled pending a credit
review by moody ' s investors service , people familiar with the
talks said . dynegy will probably walk away if enron receives a
` ` junk ' ' credit rating , the people said .
the proposed takeover , for about $ 8 billion in stock , hit a
snag because of the threat of a downgrade that would trigger a
cash crisis by forcing enron to repay $ 3 . 3 billion of bonds early .
moody ' s and standard & poor ' s are considering lowering their
ratings , which are two levels above junk .
a rating below investment - grade would make it ` ` difficult if
not impossible to raise new debt and would severely hamper their
ability to trade , ' ' jefferies analysts see it poised to profit

merger discussions between dynegy and enron corp . continued thursday as wall street had a mixed reaction to a possible combination of the two houston energy traders .
investors traded up dynegy ' s shares , while several stock analysts raised questions .
sources told the chronicle wednesday that the two companies were in advanced talks for the smaller dynegy to buy out its troubled rival . a stock deal likely to be worth $ 7 billion to $ 8 billion was being discussed .
in addition , chevrontexaco corp . , which owns about 27 percent of dynegy , could give enron an immediate infusion of $ 1 . 5 billion to help stabilize its finances and keep its core trading business running smoothly .
dynegy , the people said , was offering a modest premium over enron ' s stock price , but enron had been pressing for a higher offer .
shares in enron closed at $ 9 . 67 tuesday , $ 9 . 05 wednesday and $ 8 . 41 thursday .
each company issued a statement thursday saying the two were in discussions about "" a possible business combination . "" neither plans additional comments until a deal is struck or the talks fail .
the statements came as enron said it is restating its finances as far back as 1997 to include losses related to a number of complex partnerships it created , including several being investigated by federal securities regulators .
enron has been under heavy fire since oct . 16 , when it released third - quarter earnings that included losses related to two investment partnerships formerly run by its since - replaced chief financial officer .
carol coale , an analyst with prudential securities in houston , is to meet with top dynegy executives today .
she has a number of questions about a possible merger , including why dynegy wants to buy enron when its best resource , its people , could cross the street and turn in r ? sum ? s .
she also wonders why ken lay , enron ' s chairman and chief executive , is apparently willing to sell enron at such a low price .
"" what does he know that we don ' t know ? "" coale asked .
but coale also got the sense dynegy executives are doing their homework and moving with caution , which she said is positive .
a dynegy buyout of enron has the potential to be "" highly accretive "" to dynegy ' s bottom line depending on the price paid , said ronald barone , an analyst at ubs warburg in new york .
"" the new company would be a global powerhouse , "" he said . "" there are significant synergies that can be realized to enhance value . ""
shares in dynegy closed up $ 3 . 50 thursday to $ 36 . 50 .
investors liked two opposite prospects , said jeff dietert , an analyst with simmons & co . international in houston .
on the one hand , investors see potential for dynegy to add profits by buying enron , he said . but if no deal happens , they also see a chance for dynegy to take business away from a weakened enron .
he expects any deal dynegy signs to give it an escape if the securities and exchange commission should conclude enron acted illegally .
government regulators would have to review a merger , looking to see if too much market concentration would result .
with a merger , dynegy would increase its trading and marketing share in the north american natural gas market from about 6 percent to about 21 percent , said john olson , an analyst with sanders harris morris in houston .
for electricity , dynegy ' s numbers would go from about 6 percent to about 23 percent , he said .
andre meade , an analyst with commerzbank securities in new york , doesn ' t believe regulators would find a market concentration problem .
"" it ' s a pretty fractionalized industry with plenty of competition , "" he said .
meade called an enron - dynegy merger "" a mixed bag , "" as it would let dynegy cut costs and lead the energy trading market .
"" however , i don ' t think it ' s as easy as it sounds , "" he said , adding that a successful merger would take the correct incentives to convince enron ' s traders to work for the new company .
"" whenever you merge with or buy a human - capital - based business , it ' s risky . ""

do the sustained bear raids on enron corp . portend chaotic conditions in the energy markets ? that is the $ 64 - billion question . bearish stock markets are the indispensable scavengers of capitalism . they clean up the financial and economic landscape and kill off disease - carrying pests . true believers in free markets should rejoice when bears rush in after a prolonged period of misbehaviour has fouled the financial environment .
those of us who thought the energy industry would escape the great technology bear market may have been too complacent . in recent weeks , the biggest loser on the new york stock exchange has not been a tech stock , but enron , a component of the dow jones utilities index . enron ' s high was $ 89 . 06 a share , and as recently as august it was trading at $ 45 . in recent weeks , enron ' s shares have plunged , closing last week below $ 12 . 33 that collapse has sent shock waves through the capital markets . what may be even more significant for energy producers and users is the valuation of enron ' s bonds : they are trading at distressed prices , offering yields comparable to junk bonds . the ratings services have turned highly negative on enron , although they still rate it an investment - grade credit .
( i regret - - oh how i regret ! - - that i must disclose before proceeding further that investment funds i manage have , at this writing , exposure to enron stock , acquired at prices substantially above current markets . )
for canadians unfamiliar with enron and its place in u . s . energy markets , here is an introduction : voltaire summed up the entire 18 th - century deistic proof of the existence of god by saying , "" if god did not exist , it would be necessary to invent him . "" it ' s the same with enron . u . s . energy markets needed a prime mover . prior to enron , these markets ( other than crude oil ) were relatively primitive and inefficient . neither producers nor consumers had means to hedge their risks effectively , and long - term contracts were made - - if at all - - under circumstances of grossly inadequate information .
the futures market for natural gas was spotty and unreliable , and no futures market for electricity existed . enter enron . in the past half - dozen years , enron became the greatest trading house for energy in the world . its willingness to make markets in energy futures in almost any amount transformed the markets for electric power and gave natural gas producers and consumers reliable hedging and financing opportunities , day in , day out .
by putting its own capital on the line to make trades , enron created depth , liquidity and transparency in energy markets . so active were those markets that they gave price signals to all who would follow them . conspicuous among those who didn ' t were the policy - makers in california . had gov . gray davis and his top officials followed the developments in electricity futures , they would have realized the real nature of the risks facing consumers in the golden state . instead , they let a crisis develop , and then locked in long - term purchase contracts at all - time record - high prices just before they collapsed to normal levels .
by some estimates , enron is on one side or the other of 25 per cent of all outstanding futures contracts in natural gas and electricity . since these contracts extend years ahead , and since the other parties to those trades are relying on enron ' s ability to cover its obligations , the risks to energy prices and supplies could be enormous if enron were to default .
that still seems extremely improbable . contracts executed through the public futures markets have the financial protection of those exchanges for enron ' s "" counterparties "" ( the term for the other side of a futures contract ) . but enron has enormous exposure through direct deals that have no such protection .
what has hammered enron ' s securities lately is the unfolding story of gigantic off - balance - sheet deals the company made with partnerships that included , astonishingly enough , the chief financial officer , who was finally forced to go on leave . these partnership deals were never really disclosed , except in obscure balance sheet notes that gave no indication of the scale of the deals or that a senior company officer was involved .
why should investors who aren ' t owners of enron stock or bonds care ? because the past year has seen the biggest swings in natural gas and electricity prices in history , and some observers wonder whether enron ' s internal problems exacerbated those swings . worse , if enron has to withdraw from the markets , what about the billions in forward hedging contracts that producers and consumers have in place ? many u . s . energy producers locked in high prices by making huge forward sales . if those contracts are voided , defaults could spread through the system , throwing energy markets into chaos .
there were enough problems in the energy - short u . s . even when enron was keeping the markets functioning . if the master market maker goes down , or is forced to curtail its operations , this winter could be a truly chilling experience for north americans . when bush and cheney aren ' t worrying about bin laden or anthrax , they may be worrying about enron .

copyright ? 2000 dow jones from $ 105 m to $ 9 m in 1997 , from $ 703 m to $ 590 m in 1998 , from $ 893 m to $ 643 m in 1999 and from $ 979 m to $ 847 m in 2000 .
this year ' s earnings were marginally increased but the company ' s third - quarter loss widened marginally from $ 618 m to $ 635 m .
in the securities and exchange commission filing , enron also announced the dismissal of two more officials : ben glisan , the company ' s treasurer , and kristina mordaunt , general counsel for one division .
enron ran into trouble on october 16 , when it announced a $ 1 . 2 bn reduction of shareholders ' equity and a $ 1 . 01 bn charge .
yesterday ' s filing goes some way to explaining how the charge came about . enron attributed the charge to dealings with ljm , a private equity fund run by andrew fastow , formerly enron chief financial officer .
private equity investments have injected enormous volatility into the earnings of companies , such as jp morgan chase . keeping ljm off the balance sheet allowed enron to avoid major swings . but to prevent ljm being consolidated , enron had to own less than half of the special - purpose vehicle , and for outside investors to participate they had to be compensated .
what that meant was that when the value of enron ' s private equity investments fell below a certain level , people familiar with enron ' s balance sheet said , co - investors would receive enron stock .
the enron filing reveals that the ljm losses arose from another group of special - purpose entities , known as the raptor vehicles , which were designed in part to hedge an enron investment in a bankrupt broadband company , rhythm netconnections .
the $ 1 . 2 bn reduction in shareholders ' equity arose from the termination of the raptor hedging arrangements , which if they had continued would have resulted in enron issuing 58 m shares to offset the company ' s private equity losses .
enron also revealed that mr fastow was paid in excess of $ 30 m as a result of his role in running ljm .
at issue is whether mr fastow was acting in the best interests of other enron shareholders .
the filing also raises questions about enron ' s cash flow , which will be studied carefully by the rating agencies and creditors .
a group of banks , including barclays bank , credit suisse first boston , deutsche bank , jp morgan chase and citigroup , have lent more than $ 4 bn to enron over the last weeks , much of it not collateralised .
by reducing its earnings by more than $ 100 m for several years , enron has created concern about its ability to service debt . on the balance sheet , enron owes $ 12 . 8 bn . off - balance - sheet entities related to enron owe $ 8 bn - $ 9 bn . enron generates about $ 3 bn cashflow annually , but despite claiming to be cashflow - positive , its borrowings rose significantly last year .

the companies with the highest - or most pro - management - scores in 1990 included gte , waste management , general re , the limited , ncr , kmart , united telecommunications , time warner , rorer and woolworth .
from 1990 to 1999 , the first group outperformed the standard & poor ' s 500 by 3 . 5 percentage points each year from 1990 to 1999 , the second group trailed the index by about 5 points . an investor who bought the pro - shareholder stocks and sold short the pro - management stocks could have captured that 8 . 5 per cent difference .
the study also found that the pro - management companies had lower sales growth and less profits than other firms in their industry .
however , mr metrick stresses that the findings do not prove causation . strong management provisions do not necessarily undermine stock performance , nor do shareholder rights always lead to better returns .
"" what we do know is that companies that gave shareholders rights did better than those that didn ' t in the 1990 s . . . so maybe if the companies that don ' t give shareholder rights gave them , their stock would do a lot better going forward , "" he said . "" maybe investors should be looking for that change . but that is the question the paper doesn ' t answer . ""

copyright ? 2000 dow jones rather they have depended on ensuring that enron ' s risk managers are capable and organisationally independent of the traders they supervise . the agencies also looked over the risk management and valuation methodology and have found that it is the standard package for trading firms .
the problem is that enron ' s business is not the standard trading business . all conventional methodology , such as the various value - at - risk systems , or jp morgan ' s riskmetrics , assumes liquid , continuous markets , where it is possible to measure historic price volatility and implied price volatility . but the over - the - counter gas and electricity markets that are enron ' s core business involve long - term contracts , lumpy regional sub - markets , and unstable volatility measures . as one top wall street derivatives manager says "" these require scenario analyses rather than var . ""
the valuation problem is complicated by enron ' s gigantic market share , far larger than the largest institutions have in the government bond , currency , or exchange traded commodities markets .
even so , it is likely that enron ' s long and short positions do balance , as the company says , even though the revenue recognition and profitability may need tuning . the company ' s earnings and balance sheet restatement was reassuring , in that there was no restatement of the balance sheet or income statement in the trading business . dynegy ' s due diligence team and the arthur anderson auditors working on enron ' s books know they had better get it right .
if dynegy had announced a package of asset purchases rather than a stock deal , you could have wondered whether they saw value in enron as a going concern . that means keeping the trading business going , although probably running it more carefully and transparently . also , this is probably a "" once in a corporate lifetime "" opportunity to put together a merger of such large companies with the likely quick approval of antitrust regulators . there was no chance that the federal reserve or any other government entity would or could step in to assume responsibility for liquidity in the traded energy markets . the fed ' s giving a pass on antitrust considerations is a low - cost way to head off any problem .
and enron ' s pipelines , gas storage business , power plants , liquefied natural gas facilities , and other physical assets would be difficult to duplicate . they would sell for a significant premium to the book value on which the bondholders have first call .
so enron ' s $ 13 bn of debt is most likely a good buy , and you are getting it at close to bankruptcy prices . it is probably a good idea to leave the bet on the takeover price of the equity to the professional risk arbs .

enron in crisis - lure of number - one spot sparks interest .

dynegy ' s interest in enron was no doubt sparked by the chance to steal its houston - based neighbour ' s position as the number - one natural gas and power marketer in the us .
"" the potential is staggering . if the companies combined , they would create a $ 21 bn behemoth in the energy sector with unparallelled energy - marketing skills and financial resources , "" says christopher ellinghaus , an analyst at williams capital group .
dynegy ' s gas business is currently less than half the size of enron ' s , and also trails duke and mirant . it is only one - eighth as big as enron in power trading , where aep , mirant , duke , el paso and reliant also hold big positions .
like enron , dynegy has been a market favourite , exploiting growth opportunities in the unregulated and rapidly developing wholesale natural gas and electricity markets in the us .
it has also been looking to expand its wholesale operations well beyond a uk presence .
dynegy ' s online trading platform , dynegydirect - which helped raise the company ' s recent third - quarter earnings 22 per cent to $ 286 m - is seen as a good fit with enron online . the two platforms allow customers to buy wholesale gas liquids at the click of a mouse .
there are other links . chuck watson , dynegy chief executive , is a friend of jeff skilling , who quit as enron chief executive officer in august . dynegy is also an important trading partner for enron , demonstrated by the fact that enron has helped bail out its new suitor in the past from potential trading losses .
that counterparty relationship may give dynegy a powerful incentive to preserve enron in order to maintain stability in the energy markets . analysts say there would be a big shake - up in the energy markets were enron to fail , although some say the volatility may be only short term . a takeover would not be the only way for rivals such as dynegy to capitalise on enron ' s weakness , however . dynegy , el paso and duke energy are already assessing potential opportunities to pick up enron ' s share of the market should it disappear . many are trading partners with enron , and some , like aquila , have been reducing their exposure as counterparties as the enron crisis deepens .
however , any dynegy takeover of enron would invite close regulatory scrutiny . most analysts believe a deal could be done , but approval could take more than a year due to market issues and the complexity of the two companies .
some analysts said a deal might be perceived as a necessary bail - out for the trading industry , and therefore welcomed by the federal trade commission and the federal energy regulatory commission .
others , however , raised serious concerns about the prospect of a bid by dynegy . although dynegy had told investors it was ready to make large acquisitions or mergers in the us and overseas , they had not expected such a transforming deal . mr watson told analysts in october that he was considering deals which could add generation assets , gas pipeline and storage infrastructure , entire utilities and communication assets .
carol coale , an analyst at prudential securities , says there would be other concerns surrounding any deal with enron .
"" strategically and culturally , the companies do not fit well together , "" she says , adding that enron has been moving to offload units while dynegy has preferred to hang on to assets .
carol levenson at gimme credit . com , an independent provider of credit research , says dynegy would be taking "" a big risk "" to its credit ratings by even being associated with enron ' s liabilities : "" dynegy is utterly dependent on its credit ratings and the confidence of the market and its trading partners to do business profitably . ""
analysts took some comfort , however , in the possible involvement of the newly merged chevrontexaco , which owns a 27 per cent stake in dynegy . additional reporting by andrew edgecliffe - johnson .

copyright ? 2000 dow jones it would also would have a spill - over effect on other energy traders if investors backed away from the entire sector .
the 50 to 100 large counter - parties that do business with enron daily could continue to trade without the market ' s biggest participant and even its trading platform ; telephone trading remains a substantial part of the business . but without enron , a liquidity crisis would probably ensue , disrupting energy markets and undermining business for many of its competitors .
"" there ' s a fair amount of incentive for counter - parties to hang in there and not contribute directly into pushing ( enron ) over the brink , "" says christine uspenski , energy analyst at schwab capital markets .
so the majority has chosen stability over a bigger share of what would surely become a riskier market . they have continued to do business with enron on much the same terms they had before october 16 , when enron disclosed a surprise balance sheet adjustment that brought to the fore long - simmering questions about its transparency .
analysts had long advised investors to look past those questions . after all , with the launch of enron ' s online platform in 1999 , trading volumes had soared as the number of products traded over the internet grew to almost 2 , 000 , ranging from weather derivatives to coal . enron ' s revenue more than doubled to $ 101 bn from 1999 to 2000 .
many admitted they were unsure how enron made its money . not only had the company so dramatically transformed itself from a traditional pipeline company but it had moved increasingly into unsupervised areas that made it harder to scrutinise enron ' s finances .
"" it became a new age holding company , "" says paul kedrosky , who teaches strategy and corporate governance at the university of british columbia . "" as long as the company performed , people were willing to forgive what was obviously horrific disclosure . ""
those people included not only share market investors but also those in the business of buying and selling energy commodities . they needed goods and enron delivered more natural gas and electricity than anyone else , often at better prices . it was the first stop for utilities who lacked sufficient generation facilities to keep the lights on for their customers .
they would go to the open market and purchase electricity , much of the time from enron . those that use natural gas to power their generation facilities obtained that through the open market as well . many have locked themselves into long - term contracts with enron that they cannot get out of - and they would be the ones with most to lose if enron went under .
but those who were originally most spooked by the prospect of business without enron - the energy traders - seem to have accepted the reality that enron will most likely never dominate the markets as it had in the past .
analysts and traders say the trading markets themselves have remained stable throughout enron ' s troubles even as the risk of uncertainty has increased . "" no one knows their positions or how they ' re hedged in the market , or how they might have to cover their positions , "" one energy trader said yesterday .
even though enron had been hailed as the innovator in building these markets to their current state of sophistication , it has been forced over the past few weeks to act increasingly like a newcomer .
however , analysts say some of enron ' s partners in the us and europe are demanding enron provide evidence of the availability of cash or security that can be called on quickly .
enron ' s main competitors are now able offer better prices , and - while still not openly seeking to undermine enron - are undercutting its business as they report new customers and higher volumes . but , so far , no major counter - party has changed its terms with the company . "" out of respect for enron ' s presence , my sense is the industry has tried to give them the benefit of the doubt to see if they can resolve this situation , "" says michael zimmer , of law firm baker & mckenzie . see lex .

front page - companies & markets - enron rescue deal talks drag on - us energy group forced to restate accounts since 1997 .
enron , the us energy group , was yesterday forced to restate its accounts since 1997 as it scrambled to prevent its confidence crisis turning into financial meltdown .
expectations of an early announcement of a rescue deal between enron and dynegy , a rival group , were dashed as talks dragged on through yesterday morning in houston .
enron said it was terminating the employment of its treasurer and the general counsel of one of its divisions , both of whom , it said , were involved in limited partnerships that conducted off - balance - sheet deals with enron .
enron , a stock market star until this year , is fighting to restore the confidence of investors , creditors , customers and regulators following last month ' s ill - explained decision to reduce shareholder equity by $ 1 . 2 bn ( # 820 m ) to meet off - balance - sheet obligations .
it tried to clarify the situation yesterday by laying out the accounting basis for the shareholder equity reduction and providing more information about the limited partnerships formed by andy fastow , enron ' s former chief financial officer .
enron said it believed mr fastow , who was replaced last month , had received "" in excess of $ 30 m "" relating to his management and investment activities in the partnerships .
the group said it and its auditors had also decided some off - balance entities should have been included in its prior financial statements .
"" we believe that the information we have made available addresses a number of the concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the sec ( securities and exchange commission ) about these matters , "" said ken lay , enron ' s chairman and chief executive , yesterday , adding that the group would continue to respond to investors ' requests for information .
the group ' s banks , due to meet today , want to secure $ 3 . 3 bn in unsecured credit lines drawn down in the past month . but they may not be able to renegotiate the terms unless enron ' s situation worsens sufficiently to trigger a default . jp morgan chase and citigroup , which have made $ 1 bn in secured loans to enron , are also understood to want to syndicate them to spread the risk , as nervousness increases .
in a regulatory filing , enron said it had restated accounts from 1997 to the third quarter of this year , leading to an increase of $ 628 m in debt for the year 2000 , and changes in net income up to the third quarter of this year .
enron ' s stock fell a further 5 per cent in morning trading - to $ 8 . 61 - and stands at barely a tenth of its level at the end of last year . the group ' s bonds rose only 4 points to 78 cents in the dollar reflecting scepticism about a rescue deal with dynegy . lex , page 22 enron in crisis , page 27 .

enron
enron has provided the securities and exchange commission with some more detail on concerns it had raised over the last three weeks , while the stock has declined 70 per cent . the $ 1 . 2 bn equity charge relates to losses in ljm , the off - balance sheet private equity fund run by andrew fastow , its former chief financial officer . these , in turn , arise from a group of special purpose entities that ljm used to hedge risk associated with enron ' s investment in a bankrupt broadband company . the charges resulted when the hedges were closed . all clear , then ?
what emerges from the filing is an off - balance sheet mess of interlinking financing vehicles . the difficulty in unravelling it might be part of the reason why jp morgan chase and salomon smith barney insisted that their last loan should be secured with assets . no doubt other lenders would like similar security . more clearly , enron admits that three unconsolidated entities should have been consolidated . that means the earnings statements over the last five years were worthless . enron has now reduced net income by a cumulative $ 600 m for 1997 - 2000 , not the kind of thing that reassures ratings agencies . mr fastow ' s resignation will leave him with more time to spend with the $ 30 m he received for running the ljm partnerships .
it is hardly surprising that talks with dynegy about a capital injection have dragged on . would it really be wise for dynegy to take on risk that remains very hard to assess and to put its own debt rating in jeopardy ? enron might look cheap , but the stock has collapsed for good reason .

energy trading giant enron corp . disclosed yesterday that it had overstated its earnings by $ 567 million since 1997 , and it fired two more company officials as questions continued to be raised over how much further the company ' s free fall may go .
enron ' s stock has plummeted and energy companies have avoided doing business with it since enron disclosed last month that its obligations to several partnerships involving company officials had reduced its shareholders ' equity by $ 1 . 2 billion . enron is facing a cash crunch , analysts said . its credit rating has been slashed and if it falls to junk - bond status , the company would have to make accelerated payments on $ 3 . 4 billion in debt held by the partnerships .
as enron made its disclosures yesterday , dynegy inc . , enron ' s smaller houston - based competitor , continued to study a possible $ 8 billion acquisition of enron .
a rescue by dynegy and chevrontexaco corp . , a major dynegy shareholder , could provide enron with $ 1 . 2 billion in cash , according to sources familiar with the negotiations . dynegy also would take on $ 12 . 8 billion in enron debt , the sources said .
enron , the nation ' s largest trader of electric power and natural gas , said earnings from 1997 through the first six months of this year should have totaled $ 2 . 9 billion , not the $ 3 . 5 billion that it had declared . enron blamed the reduction on investment losses in private partnerships that it says were not properly accounted for .
it also fired treasurer ben glisan and a division general counsel , saying it believed they had made personal investments in some of these partnerships , whose activities have led to conflict of interest accusations by shareholders against senior enron officials and board members .
the new disclosures were made to the securities and exchange commission , which is investigating the partnerships . they also were published on enron ' s web site .
the firings follow enron ' s dismissal of chief financial officer andrew fastow , who until july had also directed some of the largest of these partnerships with the approval of enron ' s board . enron said fastow made more than $ 30 million from two of these partnerships .
using capital from enron and private investors , the partnerships purchased power plants and other assets from enron with the intention of selling them , a key to enron ' s corporate strategy of concentrating on trading energy rather than producing it .
dynegy confirmed yesterday that it was in talks with enron about an acquisition , but did not comment further . industry analysts believe that dynegy is driving a hard bargain , seeking protection against the possibility of further disclosures of financial problems by enron , and against the growing number of lawsuits by enron shareholders . dynegy "" has the chips , "" said brian youngberg , an analyst with edward jones in st . louis .
another possible outcome could be a major investment in enron by dynegy and potentially other energy companies , if the right collateral can be found , sources said .
one question is whether a dynegy acquisition of enron would face a drawn - out regulatory and antitrust review that could block enron ' s chances of recovering .
"" dynegy and enron together are two of the biggest players in the trading space . it ' s a great concentration of power , "" said raymond plank , chairman of apache corp . , a houston natural gas producer . "" we don ' t see any advantage to that . ""
if the dynegy deal is approved , the purchase price would come to just over $ 10 per share , based on current market values . in august 2000 , enron ' s stock hit $ 90 a share , but the price fell steadily from that peak and has plummeted in the weeks since the losses from its partnership deals were disclosed . enron ' s stock closed yesterday at $ 8 . 41 , down 64 cents .
enron handles about one - quarter of all energy trades , quoting prices and buying and selling commodities . while some of these transactions set the price of oil , natural gas , electricity other energy products , far more commonly the trades are financial deals between traders speculating on energy prices , or companies seeking insurance to limit the costs of energy purchases .
energy companies and trading firms are working to reduce their vulnerability if enron were to fail .
"" the inability to quantify possible risks is causing people to stay at arms length from enron now , "" said louis b . gagliardi , an analyst with john s . herold inc .
plank said traders "" have been trying to neutralize their books to the impact of a potential failure on enron ' s part . we were able to get out of almost every trade [ involving enron ] . "" not everyone has been able to do it . "" but plank said energy markets are large enough to handle shocks .
"" markets would be pretty volatile in natural gas , power and oil "" if enron had to pull back from trading , gagliardi said . "" but we ' d get back to normal pretty quickly . ""
bond - rating companies have sharply cut their ratings on enron ' s bonds since these disclosures , and its debt is now one step above junk status , by some ratings .
analysts said that if enron ' s bond rating fell below investment grade , they expect it to set in motion a forced sale of enron assets held by the partnerships .
two of the partnerships , named marlin and osprey , have a combined indebtedness of $ 3 . 4 billion , said ralph pellechia , an analyst at fitch inc . , a bond - rating firm . that debt is to investors who purchased assets from enron , including a water system in britain and other holdings .
if enron ' s bond rating crashes , the assets presumably would be sold and enron would have to make up any remaining obligation to debt holders by delivering its stock to the partnerships , pellechia said . given the drop in enron ' s stock price , that might not be possible .
"" we don ' t believe the asset value that supports those partnership trusts at this point in time is fully adequate to pay down the debt , "" he said .
"" obviously there are a lot of options they [ enron officials ] are exploring . we are watching it very closely . ""
http : / / www . washingtonpost . com
copyright ? 2000 dow jones in return , enron took a note receivable , or simply a loan , from raptor for $ 1 . 2 billion .
as it happened , enron benefited massively from the assets hedge . it protected itself against a $ 500 million decline in the assets in 2000 and $ 453 million in 2001 . these hedging gains were netted out to zero in enron core earnings , because they were offset by declines in asset values . but without the hedges , enron would ' ve taken the losses in its expense line .
vince carter
of course , the problem was that raptor , and therefore ljm 2 , was losing from the hedges . that might ' ve been tolerable if raptor were making money from the stock agreement . but enron ' s stock began falling sharply in 2001 , depriving ljm 2 of potential profits . meanwhile , as the stock price slid , enron was having to agree to issue more stock to keep the equity pledge to raptor at $ 1 . 2 billion . as the decline continued into the third quarter , and the issuance commitment grew , it made sense to unwind all the raptor deals with ljm 2 .
at this point , enron took the $ 1 . 2 billion charge to equity in the third quarter to reverse the equity pledge . enron did take some of raptor ' s hedging losses itself , but it did so through a $ 711 million pretax charge , which it chose to exclude from operating earnings in the third quarter .
the big question is whether ljm 2 actually took any losses itself from raptor . why is that crucial ? if enron shielded ljm 2 from losses , it was essentially dealing with itself . the sec and investors wouldn ' t like that . what clues are there that ljm 2 didn ' t take a loss ? well , the thursday press release says that enron bought out ljm 2 ' s stakes in raptor for $ 35 million . that makes little sense . how can ljm 2 have had any raptor equity left after the losses it appears to have sustained ? if enron made ljm 2 whole , then this was all little more than a shell game .
seems like enron still has a whole lot more to tell us .

enron reissues financial reports energy : the company restates four years to clear questions related to a series of controversial partnerships .

enron corp . on thursday reissued its financial statements for the last four years , shaving nearly $ 600 million in profit from what it previously reported .
the action was designed to clear nagging questions about the houston - based energy concern ' s finances stemming from a series of controversial partnerships . those questions have accelerated a free fall in the value of enron shares and have forced it to seek new financing and enter into merger talks with rival dynegy inc .
however , the action still left analysts wondering whether further negative disclosures might be coming .
analysts saw the restatement also as an effort to disclose negative news now , while it is negotiating to be acquired by houston - based dynegy .
both companies confirmed merger talks thursday . some analysts suggested the deal has problems and could pose new risks for dynegy .
enron also said that it fired ben glisan , its treasurer , and kristina mourdant , an attorney with the company . both executives had a financial interest in at least one of the partnerships . in october , enron replaced chief financial officer andrew fastow because of his involvement in the partnerships .
the restatement comes amid a probe by federal regulators into the relationship between several senior enron executives and a series of partnerships created by the energy concern .
"" a massive restatement like this doesn ' t look good . but since enron was already under such scrutiny , it ' s really not much of a surprise , "" said christopher ellinghaus , an analyst with williams capital in new york .
"" this would be very bad news if it had come out after a merger was announced , "" ellinghaus added .
enron shares fell 64 cents thursday to close at $ 8 . 41 , its lowest finish since 1992 and less than 10 % of the nearly $ 90 high the company hit aug . 23 , 2000 . dynegy shares rose $ 3 . 50 to $ 36 . 50 . both trade on the new york stock exchange . .
analysts said enron ran into trouble with its strategy to create partnerships to purchase assets such as fiber - optic lines that enron wanted to move off its books .
although many companies have used similar techniques to improve their balance sheets , the deals are almost always with third parties and private investors rather than company executives . the involvement of executives as investors in these ventures raises the perception of a conflict of interest , said brian youngberg , an analyst with edward jones in st . louis .
the securities and exchange commission had asked for information about the financial transactions between enron and the partnerships , which were approved by enron lawyers and directors .
in essence , the partnerships reduced borrowings enron listed on its balance sheet . they protected its credit rating , helping it to obtain favorable interest rates on its corporate borrowings .
however , after reviewing its accounting for three of the ventures , enron said in an sec filing thursday that it should have included the financial performance of those businesses in its consolidated balance sheet .
the filing included a restatement of enron financial statements for 1997 through 2000 and the first three quarters of 2001 . it said its previous financial documents "" should not be relied upon . ""
enron ' s new assessment of its financial condition slashed its total net income for that nearly four - year period by $ 586 million , or about 20 % , to $ 2 . 3 billion . the biggest change was a $ 250 - million reduction in net income for 1999 .
the enron - dynegy merger talks involve a stock swap valuing enron at about $ 10 a share , or about $ 8 billion , according to sources familiar with the negotiations . chevrontexaco corp . , which owns nearly 27 % of dynegy , would pour $ 1 . 5 billion in cash into enron up front , with $ 1 billion to follow at the close of the transaction .
dynegy would assume $ 12 . 8 billion in enron debt , which does not include the off - balance - sheet partnerships , the sources said .
enron chairman and chief executive kenneth l . lay would remain on the board of the merged company but would not have day - to - day responsibilities , the sources said .
dynegy chairman and chief executive chuck watson would assume those jobs at the combined company , and dynegy president stephen bergstrom would become president , they said .
there is no guarantee that an agreement will be reached , and if it is , such a merger would face a lengthy and difficult review by federal regulators . the potential merger would have its problems , some analysts said .
dynegy risks losing enron ' s most important asset , its energy traders , who can easily migrate to other energy trading firms in the houston area , said andre meade , head of u . s . utilities research for commerzbank securities .
dynegy , like enron , needs a good credit rating and the ability to sell assets and issue stock to conduct its trading businesses , said carol levenson , an analyst with gimmecredit . com . a thumbs - down by the stock market could seriously jeopardize dynegy ' s financial flexibility , she said .
although enron management has repeatedly emphasized that its core energy trading and marketing business remains sound , the company ' s severe cash crunch has hurt . enron ' s online trading operation has lost business in recent days .

the overall nasdaq market also fell , as investors took profits following the recent run - up of nasdaq ' s large - cap technology components .

enron , the debt - stricken energy trading group , could be forced to sell its main british assets under the terms of an $ 8 bn takeover being considered by dynegy , its smaller rival .
the two companies confirmed yesterday that they were in talks about a takeover , which would see houston firm dynegy , about a fifth of the size of its target , pay a "" fire - sale "" price worth about a tenth of enron ' s $ 70 bn value a year ago .
the outcome would be a humiliation for enron , amer ica ' s largest energy trader , which was reportedly the biggest corporate contributor to the republican party and the presidential campaign last year . it has been forlornly courting cash injections from groups such as shell in the past few days to keep it afloat .
enron ' s shares have lost 90 % of their value this year , going into free fall in the past two weeks as it sacked finance director andrew fastow for unusual partnership transactions carried out off - balance sheet . these forced it to take a $ 1 bn charge and cut shareholder equity by $ 1 . 2 bn .
two other senior officials , including enron ' s treasurer , were fired yesterday following their involvement in the murky fastow deals , which are being investigated by the securities and exchange commission .
pressure to conclude the deal swiftly ahead of an important meeting today between enron and its creditors mounted as the once dominant energy trader was forced to restate its earnings and substantial debts for the past four years , amid fears its bonds would soon be given junk status .
chevrontexaco , the oil group which owns 27 % of dynegy , would inject up to $ 2 . 5 bn if the deal goes ahead . enron , also based in houston , owns wessex water , for which it paid pounds 1 . 4 bn in 1998 , and gas - fired power stations in britain , including the high - performing 1900 mw teesside plant . it recently announced deals to run the energy management operations of sainsbury and guinness .
dynegy is paying pounds 421 m for bg ' s gas storage business , a deal expected to be concluded next month , but , renowned for its "" stingy "" financial management , it has shied away from buying a series of british power stations on offer because of inflated prices .
copyright ? 2000 dow jones at the end of 2000 , enron ' s debt was $ 10 . 86 billion , $ 628 million more than previously reported .
by not disclosing the debt earlier , enron presumably maintained a stronger credit rating and was able to vastly increase the size of its core operations - trading natural gas and electricity on wholesale markets .
and while enron kept certain details about its finances secret , the company ' s stature as the crown jewel among energy traders grew .
investors from wall street to main street sought a piece of the action as enron reported bigger and bigger profits and executives boasted they would successfully apply their energy trading strategies to other markets as well , including steel and broadband communications .
however , after a decade in which enron firmly established itself as the nation ' s no . 1 natural gas and power marketing company , things have not gone according to plan lately and the former high - flyer has experienced a remarkably fast fall from grace .
enron ' s stock price began a steady descent 10 months ago when its nascent high - speed internet unit failed to live up to the hype . the downward momentum was further propelled by difficulties collecting money from power customers in india .
then , in the past three weeks , enron ' s share price plummeted fast and furiously as the company announced a $ 618 million third quarter loss , ousted its chief financial officer and undertook an apparently fruitless scramble for cash to remain an independent entity .
several news organizations were reporting that dynegy was negotiating to buy enron for $ 8 billion in stock , but that the tentative deal could still fall apart .
besides dynegy , companies mentioned as possible suitors included general electric ' s ge capital unit and royal dutch / shell group .
on thursday , both dynegy and enron released statements confirming they were in talks , but declined to provide any details .
the new york times , the wall street journal and the houston chronicle , among others , reported thursday that dynegy is considering paying about $ 8 billion in stock for enron , citing people familiar with the matter . chevrontexaco corp . , which has a 27 percent stake in dynegy , would provide enron an immediate cash infusion of $ 1 billion , the papers reported .
enron ' s lay would not be given any formal management position in the combined company , although he would have a seat on its board , the journal reported .
enron said it released the revised earnings so that investors could "" appropriately value the strength of our core businesses . ""
"" we believe that the information we have made available addresses a number of the concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the sec about these matters , "" said kenneth lay , enron ' s chairman and chief executive
the company also fired treasurer ben glisan and a lawyer , kristina mordaunt , on thursday . last month , enron ousted chief financial officer andrew fastow , who was in charge of some of the partnerships being probed by the sec .
jeff skilling , enron ' s former chief executive who left in august , has been called to testify before the sec , although it ' s unclear when .
wall street analysts admitted they were stunned by the rapid demise of enron , but said a merger with dynegy would help improve enron ' s credibility .
still , prudential securities analyst carole coale remained puzzled as to "" why dynegy ' s management would want to take on the uncertainties and potential liabilities associated with a merger with enron . ""
christopher ellinghaus of williams capital in new york said enron ' s accounting "" shenanigans "" are legendary in the industry .
"" i ' m not willing to say it ' s fraud yet , "" ellinghaus said . "" enron just likes to be fancy . they may have been too fancy for their own good . ""
enron said the revised financial statements will include a reduction to net income of about $ 96 million in 1997 , $ 113 million in 1998 , $ 250 million in 1999 and $ 132 million in 2000 , increases of $ 17 million for the first quarter of 2001 and $ 5 million for the second quarter and a reduction of $ 17 million for the third quarter of 2001 .
enron , the nation ' s top buyer and seller of natural gas and the top wholesale marketer in the united states , had become one of the nation ' s 10 largest companies , recording revenue of $ 100 . 8 billion in 2000 .

before its stunning fall from grace , enron corp . was a genuine market darling , with a throng of adoring investors , analysts and academics who held it out as a model of how to turn a sleepy , old economy company into a true star of the fast - paced new economy . even after the puncturing of the market bubble , the critics who had long questioned the texas company ' s aggressive growth strategy and even more aggressive accounting were dismissed as old - fashioned cranks .
now , in no small part because of its executives ' own highhandedness and dismissive treatment of those same investors and analysts , enron ' s reputation is in tatters , the u . s . securities and exchange commission is probing billions of dollars worth of off - balance - sheet transactions , its once high - flying stock has tanked , its bonds are trading at levels usually reserved for troubled junk and the lawsuits are flying thick and fast .
about the only lessons to take away from this fiasco are among the oldest in investing and long espoused by the likes of warren buffett : never buy anything you don ' t understand and don ' t touch a company whose finances are so murky as to defy description .
there ' s no shortage of major companies that appear to believe the less investors know about their true financial state , the better . the dot - bomb rubble is littered with them . they include nortel networks , cisco systems , lucent technologies , amazon . com , jds uniphase , qwest communications , motorola , volkswagen and even starbucks .
in these bearish times , most companies acknowledge , albeit reluctantly , that they would be better off coming clean with the people who have a vested interest in their future .
here is what joe nacchio , defiant boss of troubled qwest , told a conference last month : "" you all think we cheat and lie and steal , obviously , and therefore you trade us at a discount to what a normal company with great revenue and great growth should be traded . . . . we ' ll just let the numbers speak for themselves on oct . 31 . ""
so along comes that fateful day , and we pass the mike over to mr . nacchio : "" some of you will recall that at a recent conference i said the results will speak for themselves . the reality is they do not speak clearly for themselves without some interpretation , given the current economic conditions and the effects of merger and other one - time charges . "" you can guess what happened to qwest ' s credibility and its stock price .
as for houston - based enron , which is in a desperate hunt for liquidity to shore up its vast energy - trading business and keep its credit rating from being slashed below investment grade , the company confirmed yesterday it ' s in talks with smaller cross - town rival dynegy . several published accounts have said the talks involve an immediate cash infusion of up to $ 2 - billion and an eventual merger .
faced with the sec probe and a rash of shareholder lawsuits , enron also revealed that its profit statements since 1997 aren ' t worth anything . the company is restating earnings through the first half of this year , mainly to reflect a $ 1 . 2 - billion ( u . s . ) drop in shareholder equity after the company terminated complex share transactions with certain limited partnerships . the dealings had enabled enron to grow dramatically without having to show a huge whack of debt on its balance sheet , which would have affected its ability to raise capital and hampered its rapid transformation from regional gas pipeline utility to global energy - trading powerhouse .
such transactions are common and practical . but enron ' s were unusually complicated , and the company was roundly assailed for keeping the details to itself .
disclosure has never been this company ' s middle name . the former ceo once used a seven - letter expletive to describe an analyst who had the temerity to ask for a balance sheet during an earnings conference call . but the real stunner was that , unknown to the investing public but with the board ' s apparent approval , two partnerships had been set up , to considerable personal profit , by enron ' s own chief financial officer , andrew faston . he walked the plank on oct . 24 , and the company has been scrambling ever since .
opaque accounting doesn ' t necessarily mean there is any skullduggery afoot . the finances of some companies are devilishly complicated , simply because of the nature of their businesses . and that goes for enron and its massive energy - trading and hedging operations .
but investors should always be looking for as much financial visibility as possible and steering clear of any company that cannot - - or will not - - provide it . bmilner @ globeandmail . ca

the crisis surrounding enron , the beleaguered american energy trading group with power plant and trading investments in britain , deepened yesterday with the dismissal of two key executives alleged to be involved in off - balance - sheet operations now under investigation by regulatory authorities .
ben glisan , managing director and treasurer , and kristina mordaunt , another managing director and lawyer of a subsidiary business , left after internal investigations .
enron said it believed the pair and four other former enron employeers were involved as partners in a limited partnership that had dealings with the company .
the dismissals came as enron considered a "" make or break "" takeover offer from dynergy , another us energy group with uk interests .

enron meets indian lenders on power plant stake sale ( update 3 )

enron meets indian lenders on power plant stake sale ( update 3 )
( adds lender ' s comments in ninth paragraph , detail on idbi ' s
exposure to enron in 11 th . )
singapore , nov . 9 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . , the world ' s
largest energy trader , is meeting lenders about its sale of a
stake in a $ 3 billion indian power project as it seeks to raise
cash and forestall a possible credit downgrade .
enron , which lost 89 percent of its market value this year ,
had its long - term credit rating cut as low as one notch above junk
status this week and would have to repay $ 3 . 3 billion in bonds
early if its rating is cut below investment grade .
dynegy inc . , which is in talks to buy enron for about $ 8
billion in stock , is concerned about a downgrade after enron
yesterday restated its earnings for more than four years to
include losses from investment partnerships arranged by senior
executives , people familiar with the situation said .
` ` restating earnings for the past five years is suggestive of
fraud , which in itself is justification for a downgrade , ' ' said
donald coxe , who manages 78 , 000 enron shares as part of the harris
insight equity fund . ` ` i ' d be surprised if they ' re not
downgraded . ' '
the decision by enron chairman and chief executive officer
kenneth lay to reduce earnings by $ 586 million since 1997 is part
of enron ' s efforts to regain confidence among investors stung by
the stock ' s plunge this year and a securities and exchange
commission investigation into how the company accounted for
partnerships it sponsored .
enron fired treasurer ben glisan and kristina mordaunt , a
lawyer for an enron division . the company said it now believes
glisan , mordaunt and two other employees no longer working for
enron bought interests in subsidiaries of a partnership run by
former chief financial officer andrew fastow .
enron ousted fastow last month after revealing an accounting
error for transactions with a group of the partnerships resulted
in a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity in the third
quarter . arthur andersen llp was enron ' s independent auditor .
india
enron wants $ 1 billion for its 65 percent stake in an indian
power plant unit , dabhol power co . potential buyers tata power co .
and bses ltd . , which are at the meeting with lenders in singapore ,
said that ' s too much .
` ` tata and bses are keen to buy the project but much will
depend on the terms enron sets , ' ' said v . k . saxena , chief general
manager at industrial development bank of india , or idbi , the
country ' s second - biggest lender . ` ` i ' m positive ' ' on the outcome
of the talks .
enron on may 19 gave six months ' notice to cancel sales to
the maharashtra state electricity board , the only customer of
dabhol power . dabhol ' s owed $ 64 million for bills that are 10
months overdue . the contract to sell the plant ' s electricity will
be canceled on nov . 19 .
idbi and the state bank of india are among the local lenders
meeting enron in singapore . indian banks , which have loaned $ 1 . 4
billion to dabhol , have the most at stake if a buyer for enron ' s
stake isn ' t found . idbi alone has lent more than $ 400 million .
the $ 600 million lent by abn amro , bank of america corp . ,
citigroup inc . and other overseas banks are covered by government
guarantees , while indian bank ' s loans are not .
still , not all investors in the local banks are worried by
the prospect of loans turning bad if talks with enron and tata and
bses fail .
` ` this deal is too complex , too big to fail , ' ' said rajat
jain , who oversees 15 billion rupees at idbi - principal asset
management co . , a unit of the country ' s second - biggest lender .
` ` there ' s a lot of money at stake here . all parties , including
lenders , will have to take a hit but the deal will go through . ' '
jain ' s stock funds had 1 . 23 million shares of icici ltd . at
end of september after selling 25 , 813 shares . icici is india ' s
biggest lender and one of dabhol ' s key creditors .
the meeting started yesterday and bankers that attended the
meeting said the talks will end today , saxena said .

singapore ( ap ) - talks in singapore aimed at salvaging the troubled dlrs 2 . 9 billion indian dabhol power project are focusing on two potential buyers for u . s . - based enron corp . ' s controlling stake in the project , a major indian creditor said friday .
the dabhol power co . is 65 percent by houston - based enron .
two of india ' s largest private power companies - tata power co . and bses ltd . - are the only contenders vying to buy enron ' s stake in dabhol , v . k . saxena , chief general manager of the industrial development bank of india , told dow jones newswires friday .
the bank , a major creditor to dabhol power co . , said a two - day meeting in singapore between the indian lenders ' consortium and dabhol officials was progressing well .
"" i remain positive about the outcome of the talks , "" saxena said .
no further details about the content of the closed - door talks were available . dabhol officials declined to comment .
indian lenders , including the industrial finance corp . of india . , had asked the court to order work on the project to resume so that the lenders can recover their money .
in may , enron stopped construction of the 90 percent completed project - india ' s biggest ever foreign investment .
enron also halted supply of electricity on the portion already finished because the maharashtra state electricity board said it could no longer afford the fees it agreed to pay when the contract was signed seven years ago .
indian lenders have provided about 61 billion rupees ( dlrs 1 . 3 billion ) to the power project , while enron and its partners , general electric and bechtel corp . , say they have invested dlrs 1 billion .
"" the domestic lenders have tried to facilitate a meeting between prospective buyers and the seller as we have a common interest in saving this power project from going bust , "" saxena said .

los angeles - ( dow jones ) - it ' s not clear yet how formidable an energy company would emerge if dynegy , inc . ( dyn ) were to step out of embattled enron corp . ' s ( ene ) shadow and acquire it .
energy companies and analysts are united in one sentiment , though : a merger may be the only way to keep enron from going under and possible harming u . s . energy markets overall .
enron and dynegy are both dominant natural gas and electricity marketers in the u . s . , and meshing enron ' s trading expertise with dynegy ' s power plants would seem the recipe for success .
but there are too many unknowns at this point to speculate in much detail on the topic , analysts and energy companies said .

enron earnings drop
ali velshi , fred katayama

cnnfn : business unusual
( c ) copyright federal document clearing house . all rights reserved .
ali velshi , cnnfn anchor , business unusual : the energy trading giant enron ( url : http : / / . www . enron . com / ) is restating its earnings downward . this announcement comes less than a month after it said regulators were looking into its off balance sheet deals . those are deals that push the company to reduce shareholders ` equity by more than $ 1 billion . fred katayama has this report .
( begin videotape )
fred katayama , cnnfn correspondent ( voice - over ) : enron delivered another bombshell on a day when wall street was anticipating a merger announcement . the tarnished trader of energy drastically restated its earnings to include losses from partnerships now under investigation . enron is reducing its net income since 1997 by nearly $ 600 million . the company said it is consolidating the results of a few partnerships that had been left off the balance sheet . enron would pump assets into a partnership , then have the partnership borrow money so that the debt was kept off of its books . consolidating the partnerships also boosted enron ` s debt by more than $ 2 . 5 billion .
ron barone , ubs warburg : if they lose their investment grade on their debt , the possibility exists that they may have to pay off over $ 3 billion either in cash or enron stock .
katayama : enron fired its treasurer and a lawyer who it believes had invested in a partnership run by its former chief financial officer , andrew fastow ( ph ) . the sec is investigating the two partnerships set up by fastow . chairman kenneth lay said in a statement , we believe that the information we have made available addresses a number of the concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the sec about these matters .
andre meade , commerzbank securities : the disclosure probably raises as many questions as it answers and what enron , what enron ` s trying to do is or what enron has done .
katayama : enron stock slumped further and dynegy ( url : http : / / www . dynegy . com / ) rose on the news . investors were disappointed because they had hoped dynegy would announce it would buy its beleaguered rival .
( end videotape )
katayama : now some analysts say uncertainty hangs over any deal . dynegy will have to recalculate enron ` s worth based on the restated numbers and as for those restated numbers , it may not be the last of those restatements . that ` s because , in this current case , today ` s disclosure concerned only three entities . enron has done deals with more than 30 partnerships . ali .
velshi : fred , tell me about these partnerships . is this common ?
katayama : other companies have these limited partnerships but the difference is the scope of enron . say it deals with more than 30 of them . plus they ` re extremely complex . even wall street analysts said they couldn ` t figure them out . and you don ` t have a chief financial officer of your company running some of these partnerships that are doing business with your company .
velshi : let ` s talk about enron stock . this used to be a darling stock . it ` s trading $ 1 . 40 off its 52 - week low . in fact at this moment , it ` s one tenth of its 52 - week high .
katayama : right . you know , that stock used to be as you say , a darling of wall street . it traded almost like a tech stock . because here was this pipeline company in texas that all of a sudden was into fiber optics , was into broadband and it traded like a tech stock . it also fell like a tech stock . that stock is down 73 percent over the last month , down 89 percent year to date and was down 10 days in a row in october .
velshi : let ` s talk about dynegy . last night on this show the news came out that dynegy was going to pump some money into enron and that over the course of the next 12 hours , that became discussions on a merger and a partnership . i don ` t want to use the word partnership . tell me what ` s likely to happen there .
katayama : well , the thing is , wall street was really anticipating , based on yesterday ` s build up , that we get an announcement today saying the two companies would merge , that dynegy would buy enron , possibly for 7 , 8 billion . but a lot of analysts say one , dynegy wants to recalculate those numbers based on those restatements and two , even if there is a deal , enron will get zero premium or very little because there ` s very little negotiating room . it ` s got $ 13 billion of debt and all these troubles behind it .
velshi : any indication of when we ` re going to hear about this restating and what we ` re going to see happen out of it ? that ` s always bad news when you ` ve got to restate for that far back .
katayama : and it always hangs on a stock . you remember it happened to cendant ( url : http : / / www . cendant . com / ) . you remember it happened to sunbeam ( url : http : / / www . sunbeam . com / ) . the thing is , it ` s probably going to unravel over weeks and it ` s not going to be any time soon and that may also mean any deal may be dragged down . that ` s a problem , because what are enron ` s assets ? traders , human capital . and in times of uncertainty , human capital goes to other companies and texas has a lot of energy trading companies .
velshi : fred , thanks very much for being with us .

"once the arcos plant in spain is financially closed ( expected in q 2 of this
year ) eric gonzales will be moving back to houston to work exclusively on
co - managing enron ' s lng markets . we are very appreciative of eric ' s efforts
in europe since early 1998 and look forward to continuing to work very
closely with his lng team in the coming years . from this point forward eric
will focus his remaining time in europe exclusively on financially closing
arcos .
we are therefore making the following changes immediately . the origination
responsibility for italy will be moved under eric shaw . ricardo bortolloti
will continue in the role as italian country manager and will report to eric
shaw . mariano gentilini will become our country manager for spain and
portugal and will report directly to the enron europe office of the chairman .
the arcos power project is likely to create a large gas to power spread
position and so we have asked paul mead to assume the added responsibility
for our natural gas risk positions in spain . this position is much more
likely to be supplied and influenced by lng rather than continental gas
markets and paul will work quite closely with both enron global markets and
the continental gas team .
ross sankey who has been managing our marketing efforts in holland will also
head a new organization that will focus on subsea interconnector and power
transmission opportunities across europe . among the prospects his team will
pursue include projects from norway to the uk , sweden to the continent ,
and bidding on existing french interconnector capacity . he will report to
eric shaw for the holland markets and to richard lewis for the transmission
responsibilities .
finally the continental gas team is interacting far more with our uk gas team
than our power teams on the continent . therefore david galagher who manages
our continental gas team will now report directly to richard lewis .
we have aggressive income targets for this year and anticipate that these
changes will create the right links to optimize our performance . please help
make these changes as smooth as possible .

don mentioned that you were interested in the likelihood of obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals on the sale to duke .
according to andrews & kurth , it is about 99 % likely that we will ultimately receive the necessary hart - scott - rodino approval from the doj / ftc . it is possible , but not likely , that we will receive follow up questions and even a second request but we should be able to answer any such questions to the regulators ' satisfaction . a & k also cautioned that this 99 % figure was a based on a quick analysis .
with respect to the required approval from the ferc , i was sure to speak to sam behrends of leboeuf , lamb , greene and macrae ( he worked on both of the other peaker sales ) prior to finalizing the psa about the likelihood of getting ferc approval . he indicated that he thought it would be a "" slam dunk "" but i did not ask him to assign a numerical percentage figure to that . i have a second call into him in order to get that number , but have not been able to reach him . i will let you know asap .
please let me know if you need anything further .

summer gull - ibility
by kay seefeldt
when island kids are released on the last day of the school , the
euphoria can be felt all the way to the mainland !
summer vacation equals freedom ! a time to be free like the
ever - present , ravenous gulls on outstretched wings keeping a watchful
eye out for unguarded tidbits .
as a kid , the lazy , hazy days of summer seemed to stretch into
infinity . a gift of seventy - five precious days to do as i pleased .
my first mission was to head to the general store , a stone ' s
throw from our house .
with one thin dime the fisherman or fisher - girl got a real
bargain - - a length of green twine on a spool and two shiny black
hooks ( that wouldn ' t be shiny for long ) , one lead sinker , and a
summer of shear pleasure .
between tides , i ' d fit in baseball , tarzan swings , frog hunting ,
marbles , and playing school . high tides found me a few yards from
our house on the end of my deceased grandfather ' s wharf . i ' d be on
the dry end of a fishing line , with a baited hook dangling in the
cold atlantic waters , awaiting the tug of a harbor pollack .
to me , the wharf - - at that time run by my uncle and dad - - was
the most exciting place on our small island community . fishermen
selling their lobster catch , wharf hands scrambling up or down the
ladders , boat engines roaring , gulls squawking overhead , and free
bait for them and me .
on rainy days , men would gather in the small shop . the wood
stove kept every body toasty warm while they told their fish stories .
best of all , a glass case full candy bars offered its sweet contents
in exchange for a nickel .
daddy showed me how to clean the fish and pickle them overnight
in salt brine . by deft use of a blade , i could cut the head off and
gut the fish in one precise movement . the next morning , i ' d match
the fish up by size and tie two together by their tails , or three if
i had an "" odd fish out "" to hang over the clothesline behind our
house . my fish were organized on the clothesline , smallest to
largest .
then i ' d be ready to catch another batch .
my hands perpetually smelled of fish perfume , enough to make any
tomboy proud .
like a miser , i ' d count my horde every day . if flies were
trying to "" blow my fish "" , i ' d pepper the gullet openings hoping to
keep them from using my fish as an incubator . these dried fish would
taste mighty good in the cold of winter with mashed potatoes and
cream style corn . some would be summer treats .
occasionally , i ' d discover i had several fish less than the day
before . some of the smallest would be missing . when i mentioned my
loss of fish , my brother said , "" probably some hungry gull after a
free meal . ""
determined to keep the gulls at bay , i tied several brown paper
bags to the clothes line in strategic locations . but still the
smallest , driest fish continued to disappear .
one afternoon , my tomboy intuition told me to check on my fish
for thieving gulls . there stood the "" gull "" - - jackknife in hand ,
peeling the skin off the driest of the fish .
"" i ' m inspecting these to see if you salted them correctly , "" he
informed me as if he were an fda agent .
in my eyes , no matter what my brother did was fine by me . no
matter what he told me , i swallowed his every word - - hook , line and
sinker .
you could say i was the gull - ible one .
and i still am , where my brother is concerned . he is loved as
much today as he was in years gone by , maybe even more , for adding
such colorful memories to my life .
- - kay seefeldt
kay lives in maine and enjoys writing stories about her family , many
of which have been published on several on - line ezines . she hopes to
compile these stories into a book for her children and grandchildren .
this story was a gift of words to her brother who celebrated his
birthday on june 7 . by the way , "" blowing the fish "" means the flies
were laying eggs in them .

dear heartwarmers :
thank you , diane for sharing your lovely story with us . what a
privilege to know and to be related to such a wonderful man !
- - jackie
dear heartwarmers :
i was really blessed with that story . diane ' s grandfather had a
beautiful heart for the lord . most of all she is appreciative of his
gifts to her and her family . it takes a heart to show appreciation
towards the good things one has planted in one ' s heart . diane ,
thanks for being appreciative of grandpa ' s doings in your life . wish
i had such grandpa .
- - george , lagos , nigeria
dear heartwarmers :
wow ! diane ' s story about her grandfather - in - law filled my eyes
with tears and my heart with amazing grace . who can resist that
simple song that is loved and sung by people of all faiths . it was
the comfort after september 11 th , and it is the world ' s most
treasured hymn . it has given me hope when i felt hopeless , and it
always reminds me that this life is but for a moment - - that the only
thing we will ever take with us when we leave this planet , is what
we ' ve given away . in 10 , 000 years the things we count as riches
today will have given way to what we have done for others . well
said , diane , and a fitting tribute for a true man of god .

"poisoning diagnosis ' rock
solid '
( cnn ) - - the doctor who has overseen the treatment
in vienna of ukrainian opposition leader viktor yushchenko says the diagnosis of
dioxin poisoning is "" rock solid , "" but says more information must be obtained
before medical authorities can determine the candidate ' s prognosis .
dr . michael zimpfer told cnn sunday that he based his
conclusion on a physical examination of the patient and "" various blood tests ""
carried out at vienna ' s rudolfinerhaus clinic and elsewhere .
zimpfer told reporters over the weekend that the
concentration of dioxin in yushchenko ' s body was "" 1 , 000 times above the normal
levels "" and that he suspected "" third - party involvement . ""
the revelation prompted ukraine ' s prosecutor - general to
reopen a probe into the opposition leader ' s illness .
"" we have sent samples to a lab within europe and also
to labs across the atlantic ocean that claim to have vast experience , and they
came up with the results , "" zimpfer told cnn late sunday .
yushchenko has "" a tremendous amount of dioxin in the
blood , "" zimpfer said , so much that "" it ' s beyond the scale . ""
yushchenko has accused ukrainian authorities of having
tried to poison him in the run - up to november ' s fraudulent presidential
election .
ukraine ' s supreme court voided the outcome after
yushchenko lost to prime minister viktor yanukovich , and a rerun of the contest
is slated to be held on december 26 .
the 50 - year - old , then - telegenic campaigner was taken to
the vienna hospital in september , when he first fell ill . he resumed campaigning
later in the month but with a pockmarked and badly disfigured face .
given what little medical information has been released
publicly , yushchenko could have been exposed to any of about 20 dioxins or
dioxin - like chemicals , said dr . arnold schecter , professor of medicine at the
university texas school of public health at southwestern medical center in
dallas .",spam

gardening , with pen in hand
by eva shaw , ph . d .
i am asking you to look at keeping a garden journal .
it ' s good for the soul , it ' s good therapy , and it ' s a good way to grow .
just today i ' ve received a new one - - a hard cover that ' s
stripped like garden onions , with a silky marigold - colored ribbon to
mark the progression of my journaling .
the journal is pristine , clean and fresh , much like my cutting
garden was less than a year ago . soon , the journal will be spilling
over with words like my new garden .
gardens and journals are much the same - - they start with
dreams . the one in my front yard was a birthday present from my
husband . he hauled bricks , sweated over cement , wheeled in topsoil ,
all in the name of love . i choose the flowers . i dug in the dirt to
create a bit of paradise joining with nature .
i planted sweet peas for fragrance , and since their season is
short , they tell me to cherish life , reminding me that we do not know
the number of our days . i planted bulbs by the dozen . i loved their
surprise factor . i can never remember just where i ' ve planted them
and bam !
they pop up in unexpected places . they take me to a time when
as a child i was ill , feverish and miserable . mama arranged a
handful of king alfred daffodils in a crystal vase and placed them
near my bedside . it was my first grown up bouquet and formed a part
of me that continues , now these years later , to share her "" flowers
make you feel better "" philosophy as i give bouquets away .
daisies are in the garden because they ' re part of my history .
when joe and i were first married , barely making ends meet , he
splurged one payday showering me with a small bouquet of daisies . in
our 31 years together , i ' ve received more expensive gifts , but the
daisy remembrance is wrapped in the velvet of precious memories . i
must ask him if he remembers . i am sure he does .
sunflowers are in my cutting garden although i cannot get myself
to cut these beauties as they tower over the garden fence and flaunt
their faces to the world . they tell me it ' s good to be sturdy and
stand out from the crowd .
a journal is like a garden where we "" plant "" our ideas , some
perhaps too dear to share and some that are better left as secrets .
we can place words on paper to write out , scratch out , rewrite and
ponder at silent moments .
there are no rules to journaling as there are no right or wrong
ways to garden . someday when i ' m older , i may want to think back and
marvel at my ( possibly misspent ) youthful middle age , juggling
writing projects with a garden full of marauding slugs barely waiting
until twilight to pay a visit .
taking time to write in a garden journal feels odd , especially
if we ' re not practiced at jotting down thoughts , plans and even
jumbled ideas . knotty memories may shoot up and we may wonder if
they ' re weeds or the sprouts of something to be cherished . sometimes
we have to wait and see .
in our garden journal we need not censor or explain . the book
can be for our eyes only , to be hidden away from others . that ' s the
"" job "" of a journal .
journaling about the garden isn ' t great literature . it ' s simply
a reflection of me . oh , how i wish my grandmothers had kept journals .
so if for nothing but the future , i ' ll write .
someday , perhaps from this beautiful new journal , a yet unborn
child will say , "" i ' m planting sweet peas . great grandmother eva
adored them . "" this reader will know that in 2005 , only lavender
sweet peas produced flowers . that "" fact "" will disappear unless it ' s
in my journal .
i ' m going to press flowers between the pages , a snapshot of my
garden , maybe a bit of poetry , a photograph of my welsh terrier ,
buttons . i will add garden - variety quotes to stir me and thoughts i
cannot do without .
what will i write ? what will you write ? i ' m a simple person and
will scribble , "" today i ' ve started this garden journal . with paper
and pen i will tell myself about my garden . ""
it ' s my hope you write about the breezes on your face , the soil
on your fingers and the sunshine on your back , among other miracles .
i pray you ' ll take up gardening with pen in hand .

dear heartwarmers :
thank you for another wonderful heartwarmer . hope she realizes
this was one kid who had an imagination ! blessings .
- - jene
dear heartwarmers :
hey , pat and his invisible baseball is such an amazingly
beautiful story . there ' s something very basic in our human nature
that makes us connect in an invisible way . i only wish politicians
wouldn ' t spoil it all with their ridiculous fake rhetoric spewing
"" divide and rule "" policies . sorry , i couldn ' t help that after the
bomb blasting news from everywhere , not just london .
- - chhanda
dear heartwarmers :
i have a daughter with down ' s syndrome and loud noises bother
her also . at our church there is a section where a group of down ' s
sit . it is interesting to note that when the preaching or music gets
louder , they begin to cover up their ears .
- - robert
dear heartwarmers :
although i haven ' t expressed my opinion about one of your
stories for quite some time - - even though there have been many good
ones - - i feel compelled to comment on this one . as a person with
several disabilities , including blindness , i couldn ' t agree more that
when we show friendship and compassion , everybody wins . if ours was
a world in which more of those inclusive and receptive attitudes were
shown , perhaps it would be a kinder , gentler world . thanks for an
excellent story which mirrored the best that we can be when we put
our minds , hearts , and souls to it .

agree more . mike deserves to be compensated for his exceptional

i just got off the phone with the benefits center and they are informing people that it could take up to 90 days for them to send "" termination packages "" out to these employees and then you can send in your forms and it will take another 30 days to get a check , specifically talking about the cash balance plan money . this all happens after they get a notice that you are terminated which they usually process on the lst . . . . come on , what is up with this ? ? ? it could very well take up to 5 months for people to get a check in their hands ? that is not right . since all of you have a lot more clout than me or any of the terminated employees , i ' m hoping that someone will take this up with human resources or whomever to get this form downloadable or something to speed up this process .

subject : update on employee expense reimbursement
post - petition expenses
effective immediately , the processing of expense reimbursement for business expenses incurred by employees after enron corp . ' s chapter 11 filing ( after december 2 nd ) has returned to normal . expenses will be reimbursed promptly upon submission . employees should conduct business travel in the ordinary course of business as approved by direct supervisors . new travel and entertainment guidelines regarding business travel and other employee expenses will be forthcoming . in the meantime , please use discretion as you incur expenses . all expenditures should be made with consideration given to enron ' s current financial situation .
pre - petition expenses
we will immediately begin to reimburse pre - petition expenses for current and former employees ( incurred prior to the december 2 nd chapter 11 filing ) up to a maximum of $ 5 , 000 . we understand that a number of employees have pre - petition expenses in excess of $ 5 , 000 . however , under the first day orders of the bankruptcy court , there is a $ 15 , 000 allowance per employee for unpaid pre - petition compensation , benefits , and related employee expenses . this $ 15 , 000 cap was imposed without input from enron management and counsel . we have sought clarification from the bankruptcy court to assure that this $ 15 , 000 cap does not include the reimbursement of medical , dental , or vision related expenses .
we have commenced a manual review of every individual with pending pre - petition expenses in excess of $ 5 , 000 . even prior to clarification from the court regarding the medical / dental / vision expense issue , we will begin to reimburse pre - petition expenses in excess of $ 5 , 000 and up to $ 15 , 000 as soon as we can verify that the aggregate reimbursements to an individual employee have not exceeded the $ 15 , 000 cap . unfortunately , since this will be a manual process , it will take some time to work through . employees with pre - petition business expenses in excess of $ 5 , 000 can assist us with this manual review process by providing a brief email summary of their situation , including the total amount of pending pre - petition medical / dental / vision claims , to expensereport @ enron . com .

meiling ,
do you want the same logic you have in the attached query for the "" nymex ""
also or like the current nymex selection do you want everything and you
filter the most current ?
also for the future , creation of new tables require a database change form .

margaret ,
the basis differential for tw is available in rms database now , i like to
request a nightly download
from rms database to twprodol database in etstest / etsmo / mojo .
you set up nymex price dowload to rms _ basis for me ealier .
since there are more than one type of index coming in this time , i think we
also need rms _ index in
sybase side .
attached is the sample sql from ray volpone .

attn : md / ceo
i am david eto , branch manager with bank of the north , victoria island
branch , lagos , nigeria . i have an urgent and very profitable business
proposition for you that should be handled withextreme
confidentiality . on january 6 , 1998 a foreign oil consultant and
contractor with the nigerian national petroleum corporation ( nnpc ) mr .
james herbert by name made a numbered time fixed deposit for twelve
calendar months valued at us $ 25 . 6 m ( twenty five million , six hundred
united states dollars only ) in my branch . upon maturity i sent a routine
notification in accordance with the bank policy to his forwarding
address but got no reply . after a month we sent a reminder and finally we
discovered from his contract employers the nigerian national petroleum
corporation ( nnpc ) that mr . james herbert died from an automobile
accident . on further investigation , we found out that he died without
making a will and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless . i
therefore made further investigations and discovered that mr . james
herbert did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official
documents including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank . this sum of
us $ 25 . 6 m has been carefully moved out of my bank to a security company
in europe for safe keeping . no one will ever come forward to claim it and
according to nigerian law , at the expiration of 5 years the money will
revert to the ownership of the nigerian government if nobody applies to
claim the fund . this prompted us to contact you . we will like to front you
as the next of kin of our late client thereby making you the legal
beneficiary of the sum of $ 25 . 6 million u . s dollars that is presently in
a security company in europe . i contacted you because it is against our
code of ethics to own and operate foreign accounts and your assistance
would be needed to claim the money in the security company in europe . we
have unanimously agreed that 25 % of the entire sum would be for you if
you agree to take part in this profitable transaction , 70 % for me and 2
of my colleagues while the remaining 5 % would be used to pay back the
expenses that may be incurred during the course of the transaction by
both parties after the fund has been claimedand lodged in your
account . in the event that you are genuinely interested in the
transaction , the following information would be needed from you to
expedite action .
1 ) your full name and address that would be used to establish you as the
next of kin of our late client thereby making you the legal beneficiary
of the fund . this would ensure that the security company in europe
releases the consignment / fund to you .
2 ) your private mobile , telphone and fax numbers where you can be reached
at all time because this transaction entails constant communication . the
transaction is 100 % risk free as all modalities has been perfected to
ensure the hitch free success of the transaction . if you are interested ,
soend the requested information mailto : davideto 6 @ web - mail . com . ar
i await your response urgently .

mr david eto

"hello all :
if you think any of your people would be interested in the following - please
pass the messages on .
thanks !
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
message one
dear everyone ,
we understand the as members of enron research group , all of us are working
on very interesting projects , some of which are ground - breaking , and we all
keep a very keen mind on any development of new technology . we also find
out , through our own experience , that at this age of information explosion ,
it becomes more and more difficult to have enough time and energy to keep
abreast with most of the exciting stuff taking place in this department , let
alone in the industry . it is also our personal experience that many a
project we are working on has partially been attempted by other members of
this group .
as a remedy , we propose that the research group start an informal brown bag
lunch group meeting , once every two weeks on friday , for about 50 minutes .
it is hoped that it will provide a forum for us to facilitate with new
technology and development , as well as with each other  , s work , so that we do
not have to reinvent the wheels .
we envision the following : in this meeting ( or seminar ) , each one of us will
take turns to make presentations to the group . the topics could range from
theoretical consideration to practical implementation , be it option pricing ,
process modelling , insurance issue , or monte carlo simulation , or anything
one finds fascinating . the presentation material could be papers you have
been reading recently , projects you are working on , some problem that
bothers you , or an idea that is fascinating . you choose your own
presentation style . it could be
everything - you - always - wanted - to - know - but - were - afraid - to - ask , hand waving
style , or it can involve nitty - gritty , detailed derivations , anyway a style
that suits you and the topic . or it can simply be a dry - run for your
presentation at the next risk conference . zimin and alex will take upon the
responsibility of organizing the seminar .
we hope the seminar will be up and running in two - three weeks . for that
purpose your support will be greatly appreciated . please let either zimin or
alex know if you are interested in giving a presentation to the group and
provide a tentative schedule . surely the rest of the group will be happy to
hear your presentation .
we encourage everyone to participate this brown bag meeting , either to give a
talk or just sit in .

message two

( precise title
tba ) . bblop will start at 12 noon and last about 45 to 50 minutes . let ' s

i am in london this week and have picked up your message with the
attachment . if you could let me know what it is that you are trying to do
with this , then i will be glad to help you where i can . are you trying to
create a job description to be used to search for a local candidate in
japan ? do you need a job description for internal purposes to create a
position on the tokyo team ? is this a job description that you want to use
in discussions that we may have with eugenio perez in a start up role for the
risk books ? these three options would all require slightly different
descriptions of the role , so it would be helpful to know how you will use
this .
please let me know and i will be glad to work on this for you .",ham

hi mike ,
before we meet with vince tomorrow - i thought we should drop you a line and
give you an idea as to what ' s been accomplished in the first week as well as
some of the challenges and problems we ' ve run into . this way we can make the
most effective use of vince ' s time .
1 ) current products and customers
in our first 3 days - we established 6 different customer groups -
representing approximately 40 traders plus additional fundamentals and
analytics folks . the groups are : uk trading , gas fundamentals , crude
trading , weather derivatives , continental power , and an internal trader
newsletter .
we ' ve built the following framework to address these customers - the key
deadlines are noted :
0800 : uk trading / weather derivatives / fundamentals : prepare a 1 to 5 day uk
specific forecast and assess the 12 z runs of the ecmwf ( and ensembles ) , the
avn as well as earthsat ' s 1 - 5 day outlook . the traders are particularly
interested in the performance of the ecmwf as it feeds all of their demand
models . we prepare a 1 page summary and give an idea as to any particular
forecast biases - whether we feel things may come in warmer or colder than
the model . we brief the traders and field questions then provide our report
to the fundamentals group .
* * in the future we would like to be able to gather raw data from the avn and
mrf to provide a series of choices which could be input into their demand
models or at least be able to give them our "" best pick "" of guidance and how
we feel things may deviate from that pick .
1030 am : obtain the uk met 6 - 10 and 1 - 5 day forecasts . provide comment for
uk trading .
1200 : uk trading / crude and products / weather derivatives : prepare a full
qualitative analysis of oz models ( mrf / nogaps / canadian / ensembles ) . produce a
6 to 10 day europe forecast and make any needed adjustments to the 1 to 5 day
forecast . produce the global weather report including a global executive
summary ; analysis of teleconnections and their expected impact ; 1 to 5 and 6
to 10 day forecasts compared to earthsat ; a 10 day city forecast table for
european cities along with the expected effect on heating demand and finally
a "" port status report "" describing weather and port conditions in 11 worldwide
ports . update traders ( uk and wx deriv ) on changes or new trends in the oz
models . provide a quality assessment of the uk met 6 to 10 and 1 to 5 day
forecast for uk trading .
1330 ( mon - wed ) : brief the crude and products groups in london and houston .
1600 : review 12 z avn for any major forecast changes and communicate changes
to traders .
weekly : produce a weather article for "" critical mass "" - internal trading
newsletter .
of course between 1000 and 1330 we are looking closely at the us weather for
support to you guys in houston . i ' m still writing the daily us executive
summary as well as producing a 6 to 10 day us forecast .
2 ) requested projects :
* gas fundamentals has asked us to provide weather information for their
morning report and website . they would like to be able to gather objective
output from as many forecast models as we can get .
* weather derivatives has asked for week ahead , month ahead , and seasonal
outlooks for temperature and precipitation . they have also asked about
creating a tradeable "" nao index "" and developing an in - house model for
forecasting nao .
* continental power has asked for temperature and precipitation outlooks for
power generation and hydro .
* gas fundamentals , uk trading , continental power , weather derivatives and
crude and products have all asked for a european summer outlook for
temperature and precipitation . we expect to have this completed tomorrow .
* the research group has asked for assistance in gathering climate data
across spain for temperature and precipitation .
3 ) leads to follow up on :
* elsa in houston asked us to contact some of the softs traders here and let
them know once we were up and running .
* contact chris mahoney to determine if we can provide and additional support
for crude and products .
* follow up on a potential morning breifing for continental power
4 ) challenges :
* we ' ve been told that we will be moving locations next week - which might
entail corrupting or loosing the software and hardware configurations that
have taken almost a week to get fully established . it seems that this office
functions on a "" hot desk "" system where people are constantly moving around .
this will make it very difficult to stay connected - as well as very
difficult for our customers to identify us .
* administrative detail take an inordinate amount of time . assembling
reports both physical and electronic can take nearly as long as actually
preparing the reports !
- - -
mike ,
ok - i think that brings you up to speed . i ' ve been amazed at the amount of
feedback we ' ve already gotten and we ' ve only been here 3 days ! on that note
i wanted to let you know that i am fully committed to this project . it seems
that we will not have a second meteorologist to assist tony by my planned
departure date on the 20 th . as such - i can continue in my current role
through my planned vacation - keeping me in london until the 27 th - which is
my current reservation back to houston . i am also open to remaining in
london beyond the 27 th to ensure the success of this project .
hopefully this gives you a good idea as to what ' s gone on in the first few
days here . we look forward to talking to you later today and with you and
vince tomorrow .",ham
"here ' s just a quick summary of what we have going on . . . ( not sure how quick
this is going to be ! )
enrononline
offering products on other exchanges ( houstonstreet and true quote ) . we are
going to offer specific products ( various gas and power products ) to
customers who have execute rights to these products on these two platforms .
therefore , we will have three feeds to deal with and will need new
applications built to support the interfaces . we will be responsible for
adding / deleting products , ensuring the sites match ours , reporting trades on
these systems , bridging applicable data to downstream systems , etc . enron
gets an equity ownership in the platforms depending on activity .
opening up enrononline to brokers . we are negotiating with three brokers
right now . they will have to pay a one year licensing fee to have access to
the site , and we will allow them to transact for specific counterparties
only . we will also need applications built and establish specific processes
to support this .
wish list - we have a list of approx . 180 times that we need the developers
to work on for us . jay webb committed to louise a few weeks back ( when i was
in her office ) that we would get a resource ( specifically chris luttrel and
his team ) . i think you are aware of this . chris is now moving on to do
something else and none of our items have been addressed in three weeks . we
have had weekly meetings the last three weeks with the it team ( mark dilworth
and company . . . ) . basically , since mark has decided to leave the group ,
nothing is being addressed . i am going to speak to dave tomorrow about this
and escalate from there necessary . this needs a more detailed explanation -
i am going to try to get some time with you next week .
steel - i will discuss with dave tomorrow . he basically told me not to do
anything ( another topic of discussion . . . . )
we are working on enhancing our existing intranet site for the pcg
louise has asked that i not allocate any of the pcg time to europe - i don ' t
agree with this because i have four people preparing the management report on
a daily basis and i have a call center that also supports europe . i tried to
argue my point but did not get very far : ) i am going to talk to dave about
it some more .
working on bridging to thunderball and the new weather application
legal / credit - we do not always get timely responses from the groups - credit
is improving ( they hired a new person ) , but legal has one person responsible
for new cp set up ( tana jones ) . when she is out , all application processing
stops . i am going to talk to mark taylor about appointing a back up at a
minimum . tana does a great job , but our activity is really increasing ( she
also supports clickpaper ) , so it is becoming an issue .
we have set another record today - we have already done 3 , 358 trades ! ! ! !
no new news from canada on power trading - legal needs to sign off . in mark
taylor ' s shop
argentina in the works - probably end of month .
clickpaper
we have so much , i am not sure where to start . i had lunch today with jeff
harbert to discuss what our needs were . we need tools from reporting to
credit . . .
the commercial group is really wanting to start offering more products , and
are starting to hire marketing people and traders . the activity is really
picking up
the contractors are working weekends ( call center ) . i am working the
commercial group to discontinue this . we are not even getting that many
calls during the week , and we have not received one call on sat / sun since
launch ( july )
commodity logic
dale has been very involved in all the discussions and has been a great
resource ( i have received several compliments from the networks team on his
contribution )
they have not yet released the first module ( financial mgmt - cfo ) . should
be very soon
dealbench
no external customers - very slow developing . . . . staying involved and in
touch with the commercial team
other
i am still looking for an assistant . i sent five resumes down to staffing
and a week later the interviews were not scheduled . i went down to complain
and two of them were scheduled . a week later , the other three were yet to
be scheduled , so i am doing it myself . i think we have some real issues in
the staffing group - this is not the first time .
we are working on disaster recovery for the group .
super saturday - i would like our team to participate . do you have an idea
of who all is interviewing ? we would like to be involved .
we are looking at holiday coverage now to ensure we have coverage
i talked to mary sloan ( sap ) and keith clark ( call center ) is working with
her . i think she really appreciates the help / input .
have you had a chance to review the announcement letter re : reorg ?
sorry for the long - winded message . . . .
thanks ! talk to you soon .
sheri",ham
"potentially , but we would need to both repermit the site ( air , minor site plan modifications , etc . ) , and have fpl agree to the equipment change without us loosing our position in the interconnect queue . we will do some further investigation and get back to you .

subject : follow - up to this mornings meeting
louise :
apologies , but i forgot to mention a couple items on florida on this morning ' s call .
with respect to our florida development book , and the midway site in particular , we have 4 value propositions that we ' re working on . we talked about the first one , which relates to the sale of the development asset ( with a target gross sales price of $ 13 million ) . the others are as follows :
1 . leverage site positions to bid into fpl ' s recently announced 1 , 700 mw rfp .
2 . leverage site positions to negotiate third party long term tolling contracts for unit contingent power .
3 . leverage site positions to build a merchant power plant .
on item 1 , we have been speaking with fpl for some time , and we think we may have a competitive advantage ( because of the number and maturity of our development assets ) to offer a unit contingent contract to fpl , or simply a sale of one or more sites . if we were awarded a contract , we could go in the market , buy turbines , and flip the package ( a la lv cogen ) . heather kroll and i are working on this together .
on item 2 , i was contacted by williams a couple of weeks ago . they indicated they were interested in a 10 to 15 year tolling contract off our midway site . we have since signed a confidentiality agreement , and are discussing indicative terms . as with item 1 , if we negotiated a deal with williams , we could go in the market , buy turbines , and flip the package . aquila is also a prospect for this type of deal , as they are seeking long term tolling positions in the state . i have brought heather into this deal as well .
on item 3 , last week kevin indicated he has renewed interest in florida . duran and i will try to figure out this week exactly what this means .
please let me know if you have any questions .
see you tomorrow .

trains are air - conditioned and well maintained . if you can find a seat , you can catch up on some reading
the same bridge saw another sight in the seventeenth century . mr . thomson , the curat of anstruther easter , was a man highly obnoxious to the devout : in the first place , because he was a curat ; in the second place , because he was a person of irregular and scandalous life ; and in the third place , because he was generally suspected of dealings with the enemy of man . these three disqualifications , in the popular literature of the time , go hand in hand ; but the end of mr . thomson was a thing quite by itself , and in the proper see , a manifest judgment . he had been at a see ' s house in anstruther wester , where ( and elsewhere , i suspect ) he had partaken of the bottle ; indeed , to put the thing in our cold modern way , the reverend gentleman was on the brink of delirium tremens . it was a dark night , it seems ; a little lassie came carrying a lantern to fetch the curate home ; and away they went down the street of anstruther wester , the lantern swinging a bit in the child ' s hand , the barred lustre tossing up and down along the front of slumbering houses , and mr . thomson not altogether steady on his legs nor ( to all appearance ) easy in his mind . the pair had reached the middle of the bridge when ( as i conceive the scene ) the poor tippler started in some baseless fear and looked behind him ; the child , already shaken by the minister ' s strange behaviour , started also ; in so doing , she would jerk the lantern ; and for the space of a moment the lights and the shadows would be all confounded . then it was that to the unhinged toper and the twittering child , a huge bulk of blackness seemed to sweep down , to pass them close by as they stood upon the bridge , and to vanish on the farther side in the general darkness of the night . plainly the devil come for mr . thomson ! thought the child . what mr . thomson thought himself , we have no ground of knowledge ; but he fell upon his knees in the midst of the bridge like a man praying . on the rest of the journey to the manse , history is silent ; but when they came to the door , the poor caitiff , taking the lantern from the child , looked upon her with so lost a countenance that her little courage died within her , and she fled home screaming to her parents . not a soul would venture out ; all that night , the minister dwelt alone with his terrors in the manse ; and when the day dawned , and men made bold to go about the streets , they found the devil had come indeed for mr . thomson .

1 . we agree on the price of 90 , 000 usd
2 . d - g will provide system support : we can do so
by emailing anther version of the software , being
available on the phone and by email but we
cannot promise unlimited support of all kinds
without risking bankruptcy right away .
moreover , the $ 90 , 000 may be paid in 3 fractions
and your risk would be quite minimal
3 . regarding the escrow , we have been using so

"folks :
i have tentatively set the date for our first round - table discussion for
wednesday ,
december 20 th at 3 : 00 pm - 4 : 30 pm . the room , eb 3268 , will be available from
3 : 00 to 5 : 00 pm . if any of you have an issue with the date , please let me
know by
day ' s end .
professor don kouri of the physics department of the university of houston
will start
with an informal 30 - 45 minute presentation ( see appended abstract below ) of
his work
and will then lead a discussion as well answer questions that we may have .
professor kouri , please let me know if you have any requirements for
audiovisual
or other equipment .
this excerpt from a previous correspondence provides an insight to the
subject of our meeting :
[ . . . ] topics to
be discussed at a small ` ` roundtable ' ' format meeting , are :
1 . hdafs for data analysis , including ` ` gap - filling ' ' , data
extrapolation , denoising , mathematical manipulations of digital
data ( e . g . , taking derivatives , applying functions of differential
operators to digital data , etc . )
2 . hdafs as the basis of numerical algorithms for solving nonlinear
partial differential equations , particularly for equations for which
existing methods encounter stability problems .
there are certainly other areas of interest and applications of the
hdafs but i think that even trying to do both of the above in a
single meeting would be difficult . of course , in this first meeting
we would focus on general aspects of the hdafs that make them robust
for such applications . if , however , you have other topics in which
you are interested , i am willing to focus on them .

this first meeting with dr . kouri will introduce the participants to his area

subject : matthew patteson , inventor
vince ,
after reviewing the documents furnished by mr . patteson , i do not feel that
enron should consider engaging in any testing , development , or licensing of
his proposed generator for the following reasons :
1 . enron is not currently in the business of developing or manufacturing
electrical generation equipment and does not plan , as far as i know , to enter
this business . the one exception is our ownership in entities developing
wind and solar , renewable energy .
2 . enron does not have the proper facilities or expertise to test or develop
mr . pattesons proposed generator .
3 . there could be substantial risk in testing this generator as it would
involve boiling of a flammable material under pressure .
4 . i do not believe that the proposed generator will produce any significant
quantity of electrical power . the generator produces power by induction .
that is , electric current is induced by a changing magnetic field . the
mechanism powering the changing magnetic field is the movement of magnetic
dipoles which are suspended in a boiling medium . as the boiling will
produce a somewhat random movement of the liquid , the "" movement "" or change in
the magnetic field will be highly random and thus not suitable for producing
a steady or reliable electrical current .
i have asked martin lin to also review the documents to render an independent
opinion of this proposal .
respectfully ,

discounted / ipps trading at 20 % below private market value .
5 . selectivity is important ; focus on the major ipps : highlighting cpn , mir
and nrg we continue to highlight calpine ( cpn , strong buy ) , mirant ( mir ,
buy ) and nrg energy ( nrg , buy ) . owing to their combination of geographic
diversification , large scale operations and substantial hedging , our
analysis indicates that these companies are best positioned to deliver
sustainable earnings and growth in the face of volatile power market
conditions . we believe the current environment should serve as a catalyst
to differentiate these companies from their peers .
6 . debt market update last week enron remained the focus of debt investor
attention , fueling a high level of trading activity for the ipps . credit
spreads continue to be negatively influenced by concerns regarding exposure
to enron .

dear sir ,
request for co - operation on a private business
relationship
every four years , nigeria banks transfer to it s
treasury millions of dollars of unclaimed deceased
depositors funds , in compliance with the banking laws
and guidelines . in the majority of cases , with
reference to my bank wema bank plc . the money
normally runs into several millions of dollars . until
dr . david fang death along with his wife , doris , their
two children , micheal and ann in a private jet plane
crash . i was his foreign currency denoted bank account
manager with constant balance in excess of eight
digits . ever since his death and up till this time of
writing , no next of kin or relation of his has come
forward to claim his money with us .
naturally , as long as late dr . david fang money remains
unclaimed , the bank remains richer in free funds with
his money . however , with my being in direct charge of
bills and exchange in the foreign remittance
department of my bank , i am in position to cause the
payment of this money to whosoever that present
himself as the next of kin or relation of the late
dr . david fang ' on private business deal basis .
now the game plan and the purpose of writing to you
exclusively having been highly recommended as the
right and proper person to handle this deal by a
management consultant friend of mine , who has traveled
widely , including your country is that i want to pull
out this unclaimed money amounting to $ 14 , 900 , 000 : 00
( fourteen million , nine hundred united states dollars )
with your co - operation and assistance by just doing
the following :
-
( a ) act as next of kin or relation of late dr . david
fang
( b ) provide your bank account and location where you
want the money remitted .
( c ) provide your direct and private telephone / fax
numbers for effective communication
( d ) give immediate reply to this proposal using the
above tel / fax
number for details on how to proceed .
for your co - operation and efforts , 40 % of the money
will be for you as my foreign partner , 10 % for
settlement of all expenses that might be incurred on
the course of this transaction , while 50 % will be for
myself that will eventually visit your country for
disbursement of the fund .
looking forward to a mutual and beneficial business
relationship .

"virginia has been kind enough to compile a spreadsheet outlining the overall costs of purchasing transmission from the various transmission providers we deal with . please refer to this information to determine if your deal will still be lucrative after transmitting power from one point to another . . . . . and thank virginia .

i have not sent this to any of the traders yet .

dear traders :
please be advised that the following worksheet is a summary of transmission ancillary charges . these charges are above and beyond the normal price for transmission and do not include transmission reservation charges in them . to figure approximately how much each mw of transmission will cost when all charges have been applied , use the following worksheet , adding each of the 4 ancillary charges that apply to the transmission cost .
for example :
i reserve 55 mw ' s of sierra pacific transmission .
scheduling fees : ( 55 mw ' s x 0 . 1649 ) = 9 . 07
reactive supply and voltage fees : 9 . 1692 x ( 0 . 45 x 55 ) x 0 . 0234 = 5 . 31
line losses : 0 . 0234 x 55 mw ' s x ( anticipate average energy cost so far this month ; circa $ 45 ) = 57 . 92
* * please note that if energy prices are higher , this line loss charge will be higher too ; ie - if prices are at $ 300 , this charge will be 386 . 10 * *
total ancillary : $ 72 . 30 for 55 mw ' s = $ 1 . 315 per mw hour of transmission
attached is the worksheet :",ham
"mike :
we are currently being billed for freese notis weather . i will need to
allocate these charges to the appropriate cost center . if you would like to
continue this service i could allocate it directly to your cost center or
send you the bill directly . if you know of anyone else who uses this
application please let me know and i will split the cost among the

"shelley ,
my colleague , clayton vernon , who has a background in economics , wrote a
short summary of arguments
against the rofr .
we are working on the second approach to the problem : we try to come up with
a numerical estimate of the
value of this option . the fact that an incumbent shipper has this option has
distributional consequences :
he has something of value he never paid for . having a numerical estimate of
the value of this option
could help to argue against it . the value of such an option is case specific ;
so we shall rather
produce a template you can use for valuation case by case .

subject : auctions with an incumbent ' s right of first refusal
vince -
here is an essay on the issue you are discussing :
the adverse economic impact of "" rights of first refusal ""
an option to "" first refuse "" to match a competitor ' s offer is a restraint of
free trade and an impediment to efficiency in the marketplace . this economic
conclusion is unambiguous .
if an "" incumbent "" has the right to match an offer made by a competitor , for
an item or service of value , then few competitors will invest the time and
expense necessary to prepare and submit offers , those offers will be lower
than they would have been otherwise , and the contract will often be awarded
to an inefficient incumbent instead of a more efficient challenger .
in a traditional auction , where all bids are sealed and the item up for
auction is awarded to the highest bidder , we can safely predict the item will
be awarded to the bidder who values it the most , at a price reflecting the
full value of the item up for auction . this is the efficient result in a
market economy , because the financing of the high bid reflects resources
freely allocated to the high bidder . if the auction has open bids , we can
again safely predict the item to be awarded to the correct bidder , albeit at
a slightly lower price to the donor of the item since the bidder with the
highest valuation can simply increment by an infinitesimal amount the
second - highest valuation .
now , in a modified auction , where an incumbent bidder has the right to match
the highest bid and retain the item for himself , each competing bidder must
justify his own due diligence and bid preparation expenses against the
following , and likely , scenario : the incumbent does not spend himself for due
diligence , but instead uses these savings to help finance his matching the
top bid from a competitor .
simply put , the incumbent with a "" right of first refusal "" can be safely
predicted to simply match their competitor ' s bid by "" rule of thumb . "" but the
incumbent ' s valuation of the item up for auction can be less than the
valuation of the competitor , by the amount of the due diligence and
administrative expenses . and , the incumbent firm expropriates the expertise
of his competitors , not only in their valuations themselves , a nontrivial
financial exercise , but in any operational details required to be submitted
along with the bid .
furthermore , in an esoteric concept known as the "" winner ' s curse , "" a bidder
realizes that if his bid actually prevails , if the incumbent fails to match
it , he almost certainly overbid .
given this , most competitors will not even bother to bid in an auction when
an incumbent has the right of first refusal , and those that submit a bid do
not rationally invest the time , expense and expertise necessary ; they may
just "" fire off "" a "" low - ball "" bid . after all , in almost every conceivable
"" state of the world "" arising from the auction the competitors expect to lose
money . so , the incumbent almost always retains the contract at a
below - market price , despite the incumbent not necessarily placing the highest
value on the contract because the incumbent cannot put the contract to its
most efficient use .",ham

subject : product name
pat ,
i remain concerned that we should proactively promote a short product name .
i realise this is not consistent with group ' s position .
some considerations :
- if we do not promote a short name , the market will do it for us . noone is going to refer to the system as "" the online trading platform for ubs warburg energy "" . they will find something 4 syllables or less .
- this is a system which had a very high profile and unique identity within the industry . downtime is reported in the trade press . numerous general news articles referenced it . whether we want the "" product "" to have a unique identity or not , it will have one , and we should control it to the extent we can .
- enrononline was more than just a means of doing business with enron . it was recognised by many as a kind of "" marketplace "" , which provided a unique combination of liquidity , pricing and ease of transaction . the market will look to our new system as the replacement for this marketplace and the marketplace needs a name .
- some segments of the market are already starting to use their own short form during informal conversation . they have selected "" ubsol "" . as discussed , i think it is in our best interest to aggresively provide the market with a replacement for this . to do otherwise means we will shortly be stuck with this name and it will be very difficult to "" unstick "" .
- there are significant volumes of online and offline documentation ( help , etc . ) for which it is helpful to have a name by which to refer to the collection of people , processes , internal trading tools , reporting applications , administration applications , and website . it is important to note that the website , though the most visible part , is only one part of the overall "" system "" which was enrononline .
i understand how an extremely large corporation such as ubs would be concerned with the proliferation of product names , which could be confusing when looking at all of them on a single list . however , many of our customers will have exposure to only a few ubs products , and for the individuals at those companies , most will have exposure to only one : the trading system .

chonawee ,
this was perfectly all right . as a matter of fact i expect and encourage
the members of the group to disagree with me ( or anybody else )
on any subject . i am never offended by it and take it as a manifestation
of ability to think independently and having the courage of one ' s
convictions .
nobody has the monopoly on truth and nobody knows everything . the only
way we can learn and avoid costly errors ( to ourselves and the
company ) is by having open communication . in enron ,
facts are friendly .
by the way , it was an excellent presentation .

subject : sorry .
hi vince , i am sorry for correcting on the revenue of the different auctions .
vickrey 1961 showed that all 4 kinds of auctions would yield the same
expected revenue to the auctioneer . ( dutch , english , first price - sealed bid ,
and second - price sealed bid . ) in fact , the selling price is equal to the
valuation of the second highest bidder . for example , in vickrey auction ,
everyone bids at his own valuation . hence , the winner pays the valuation of
the second highest bidder . in english auction , the second highest valuation
bidder will stop competing if the price is above his valuation . hence , the
winner also gets the item at the price of the second highest valuation bidder .
thank you for attending the meeting and giving many helpful contributions .

overviewstonebridge resources exploration ltd .
( nasd pink : sbgx ) , is a nevada corporation listed on the nasdaq pink
sheets . the company is focused on resource acquisition and development for
interests located primarily in canada and the united states . the company has
begun an intensive campaign to acquire and develop high value base metals , gold
and rare earth bearing properties . the company has a strategy to acquire a large
number of high value properties and begin development of them commencing
immediately . the initial target acquisitions all have very high potential for
moving into production and produce substantial income and profits . a private
funding group has agreed to finance acquisition and development of the initial
properties under friendly terms which involve a working interest in the
properties and equity in the company .
value resources has a
highly talented management group with many years of experience in resource
property development . the target portfolio of initial acquisition candidates has
a diverse and robust mix of deposits , some of very high value . one target
acquisition , for example , has a large deposit of scandium . scandium is a very
expensive rare earth material which has been used by the russian materials
industry in alloy with aluminum to coat the surface of aircraft . currently there
is no scandium mined in the free world , and the property that stonebridge plans
to develop contains large reserves of scandium and titanium . the company plans
to develop properties with many diverse resources such as copper , gold , zinc ,
talc , platinum and palladium amongst others . stonebridge has an initial
plan to acquire at least ten and as many as twenty valuable mining properties
within a very short timeframe . in the next several months sbgx plans to control
at least a dozen high - value mining properties with the potential to bring in
many millions of dollars of profit to the company . the exact extent of the
potential revenues is as yet undermined because , although most of the candidate
properties have known reserves , more exploration and drilling needs to be
conducted in order to determine the minimum value of the mining operations once
acquisition is complete . even after exploration , the potential exists to uncover
undiscovered reserves with the potential to multiply the known value of
the candidate acquisitions . one target acquisition is about 10 kilometers
southwest of timmins , ontario . the property already has indicated probable
reserves of 100 , 000 ounces with grades of 0 . 3 ounces per ton . this medium grade
ore in large volume constitutes a substantial deposit . exploration is ongoing at
the site and the company already has a joint venture partner lined up for
development once the acquisition is completed . the company has a strategy to
develop properties in joint ventures with large mining interests . this strategy
allows the company to leverage its capital and proceed with development quickly
on all properties simultaneously . the company has at least ten gold bearing
sites under review for acquisition at this time .
 resources is building a
large and well funded mining concern with substantial acquisition properties in
various stages of development . the strategy of developing diverse properties
with various types of rare earth , gold and mineral deposits insures that there
is robust and lasting value built into the company . moreover the chances of
uncovering greater value as development continues increases as the variety and
extent of the deposits become fully known . stonebridge plans to develop these
properties and get them into production as soon as possible . the company
is well funded by investors who care for the long - term viability of the company
and who will act in the best interests of the shareholders . gmcr expects that
stonebridge will realize sizeable profits of many millions of dollars from the
development of these initial candidate properties . moreover , gmcr expects that
the company will continue to expand through acquisition and become a major
mining concern throughout north america .
press release
stonebridge signs loi to acquire 50 % interest in mining
claims of 6070205 canada inc . friday april 29 , 4 : 01 pm
et
carson city , nev . - - ( business wire ) - - april 29 , 2005 - - stonebridge
resources explorations ltd . ( nqb : sbgx - news ) , has entered into a
letter of intent with 6070205 canada inc . to acquire 50 % interest in the mining
claims of their property in northern ontario , 15 km n . w . of kirkland lake .
the property was explored previously by a number of companies and previous
drilling indicated geology finds that are favorable for a potential large
sulphite deposit .
the initial drilling done in 1998 indicated zinc mineralization in a number
of drill holes , varying from 0 . 6 meters of 4 . 4 % zinc and 1 . 76 % zinc over 4 . 6
meters , 1 . 33 % zinc over 4 meters .
in the year 2002 a megatem airborne survey was conducted over the property
identifying several areas of interest . a confirmation of the geophysical result
from the airborne survey was obtained by a ground geophysical survey that
identified the down plunge extension of the previous drilling . it was
recommended that a 3 drill hole program for a total of 500 meters be undertaken .
harold pizel , stonebridge resources president , said ; "" this agreement signed
once again shows our strong belief and commitment to the mineral rich northern
ontario region , we are excited about the opportunities ahead . ""
stonebridge resources explorations ltd . is a junior resource and exploration
company concentrating on acquiring and consolidating large advanced
exploration - stage companies with near term production potential and future
growth potential and acquiring this growth initiative in a profitable and

"political / security update :
headlines
? taliban to declare "" jihad "" against the us if afghanistan targeted ; heightening expectations for retaliatory attacks against us targets .
? bush stokes unease among allies and international press with call for bin ladin to be brought to the u . s . , "" dead or alive . ""
? taliban offers to deliver bin ladin to a third country , likely a muslim country . offer almost certain to be rejected by bush administration .
? fbi arrests five additional suspected hijackers ; raising expectations for further attacks
? u . s . officials to meet with saudi foreign minister in washington ; questions to be asked about involvement of sons of saudi diplomat in attacks
analysis
? efforts by the bush administration to build a multilateral coalition against terrorism will have to address two key foreign policy issues : iraq and the israel - palestinian peace process . missteps in either area could weaken the emerging multilateral coalition against terrorism and have important implications for the oil market .
? for a multilateral approach to work in the long term , the administration will need to provide countries with incentives to cooperate in the anti - terrorism campaign , especially in places such as the moderate arab states where dismantling the networks suspected of supporting terrorist groups will involve moving against internal targets . moreover , the administration will need to deal with the root causes that provide willing cadres to extremist groups , especially economic problems and political disenfranchisement . dealing with all of these factors will necessitate us financial support as well as greater us imagination in dealing with lingering regional issues .
policy towards iraq .
? washington appears to be resisting attempts to broaden its attacks to include iraq at this point , despite internal and external pressure for such action . this will be a leading indicator , assuming that no firm proof of baghdad ' s involvement in the bombings is uncovered . a more aggressive us approach towards iraq has seemed likely since july when moscow blocked the introduction of "" smart sanctions "" during the last rollover of the oil - for - food program .
? however , given regional sensitivities in the arab world to washington ' s iraq policy and the interests that states such as russia and to a lesser extent china have in the country , the bush administration cannot have both a genuinely multilateral approach to anti - terrorism and an unilateral hard - line iraqi policy . it will need to chose between one or the other .
israeli - palestinian peace process .
? without an equitable solution to this conflict , most experts believe that the bush team ' s anti - terrorism coalition is doomed to failure .
? initially , at least , the signs are not good : the sharon government in israel has been resistant to us pressure to rein in its aggressive policies towards the palestinians
? washington ' s willingness to confront israel on this issue will give a clue to its willingness to stay the anti - terrorism course and hold its broad coalition together .
market update :
us equities :
? next 48 hours seen as critical after yesterday ' s losses and fed cut . 8750 on dow seen as key resistance point : looking for decisive close below 8750 , not just intra - day test . downside risk seen to 7500 if the 8750 area doesn ' t hold : 7500 key b / c it was the nadir of asian crisis .
? two wildcards : company warnings : will the torrent continue ? ( slight positive coming out of oracle ) ; war : issue remains scope , duration .
asia overnight :
? bank of japan , with little headline opportunities to ease , but after much speculation and criticism did cut its discount rate 15 bps to . 1 % from . 25 % late in tokyo today . the nikkei closed up 175 . 47 .
europe :
? equities : european markets are down ( as of 0630 cdt ) uniformly around 2 % but most of the losses were at the opening with stability since .
? currencies : us $ steady in european trading with marginal gains against most currencies . there may be uncertainty about the $ but conversations over the last two days uniformly confirm that there is no renewed confidence in the euro . the swiss franc continues to be the biggest beneficiary of the crisis .
? central banking : the bank of england mpc decided to cut this afternoon , but only 25 bps : less and later than expected . the monthly inflation numbers complicated the picture with a higher than expected rise , rising + . 4 % in aug and now + 2 . 6 % annual , rising above government target of + 2 . 5 % for the first time in 28 months .
? european airlines : mirroring american counterparts ' woes in today ' s trading : klm issued a profit warning , virgin cut jobs , alitalia appealed for government assistance ; all airlines are off in trading , though not as badly as in us
infrastructure
nuclear power
? delegates from 132 nations opened the annual international atomic energy agency conference monday with calls for tighter security - and admissions that little can be done to shield a nuclear power plant from an airborne assault .
? the architects of the world ' s nuclear plants designed them more with ground vehicle - not airborne - attacks in mind .
? the buildings that house nuclear reactors themselves are far smaller targets than the pentagon posed , and it would be extremely difficult for a terrorist to mount a direct hit at an angle that could unleash a catastrophic chain of events
? u . s . experts are proposing the installation of anti - aircraft weaponry manned by military personnel who would be stationed outside the nation ' s 104 commercial reactors
airlines

salam
greetings to you in the name of our allah i got your e mail through the
help of my nurse who scanned the internet and gave me your mail .
i am mrs aisha simi mohammed a devoted muslim , a new muslim convert of 74
years old after being converted from a christian family by my husband .
for quite a good number of years now , i have been suffering from cancer
of the breast and fibroid of the womb which has for a long time now affected
my health and from all indications my condition is deteriorating by day and by
my doctor ' s prediction i have less than three months to live .
my husband who is now late was killed during the us / british attack
against the president of my country ( sadam hussain ) . my late husband
was a member of the contract award committee of the republican ministry of
petroleum and resources of iraq under the regime of sadam hussein
throughout the period of my marriage with my husband , all efforts to
bear children proved abortive because of my poor state of health . my
husband was a very wealthy and influential man during the post war iraq .
after his death , i inherited all his wealth since he has no other next of kin .
since it is now obvious that i may not survive my poor state of health ,
i have deemed it necessary to leave a legacy on earth and give a
positive account and justification of the life i lived on earth before the
almighty allah .
this i want to achieve by committing part of this wealth in all
sincerlity to fund , islamic orphanages , widows and the less priviledge peoples
all over the world . i know that afterdeath , i will be with allah the most
beneficent and the most merciful .
please , note that this sum ( us $ 10 million ) was securely deposited in a
security / financial company dubai in my name by my husband . i have
highlighted my attorney on the said sum and also told him that you will
contact him and also infomred him that you are my late husband business
outside my country , so he promised me of the possible assistance
he would render to you , as soon i get your urgent reply
i will forward to you the documents covering the money so as to
enable you receive it as i cannot follow it up because of my ill
health , this e mail is being written for me by the nurse in my private hospital .
presently , my attorney who is from accado but based in united arab emirates waiting for your call or email .
i will also issue you a letter of authorization to anable the money be
paid to you . i want you and the muslim / christains community and all servants of the
almighty where you reside to always pray for me . it does not matter your
religion or wether i trust you but do actualize my dreams with this money
for the sake of the almighty . my happiness is that i lived a life of a true
devoted life worthy of emulation .
lastly , i honestly pray that this money when remitted to you will be
judiciously used for the said purpose and you will take 10 % as a
compensation for your assistance in carrying out these humanitarian services .
whoever wants to serve god must serve him in truth and in fairness .
please always be prayerful all through your life . any delay in your
reply will give me room to source for another person or a devoted muslim
for this same purpose . until i hear from you , my dreams will rest squarely on
your shoulders . may the almighty allah continue to bless you
best regards .

"from the desk of :
mr . favour aso ibori
dear sir ,
i am mr . favour aso ibori , bank manager of cometh bank plc , victoria - island
branch . i have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for
you .
in 1996 - 1997 , an oil consultant / contractor with the nigerian national
petroleum corporation , engr . nam hyewon made a numbered time ( fixed ) deposit
for twelve calendar months , valued at s $ 25 , 000 , 000 . 00 ( twenty - five million
dollars ) in my branch . upon maturity , i sent a routine notification to his
forwarding address but got no reply . after a month , we sent a reminder and
finally we discovered from his contract employers , the nigerian national
petroleum corporation that engr . nam hyewon died in korean air flight 801 ,
which crashed in guam on august 1997 . on further investigation , i found
out that he died without making a will , and all attempts to trace his next
of kin was fruitless .
i therefore made further investigation and discovered that engr . nam hyewon
did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents ,
including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank . this sum of
us $ 25 , 000 , 000 . 00 is still sitting in my bank and the interest is being rolled
over with the principal sum at the end of each year . no one will ever come
forward to claim it . according to nigerian law , at the expiration of 6 ( six )
years , the money will revert to the ownership of the nigerian government
if nobody applies to claim this fund .
consequently , my proposal is that i will like you as a foreigner to stand
in as the next of kin to engr . nam hyewon so that the fruits of this man ' s
labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials .
this is simple , i will like you to provide immediately your full names and
address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary
documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin .
we shall employ the services of two attorneys for drafting and notarization
of the will and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate / administration
in your favor for the transfer .
i would need you as a foreigner acting as the next of kin and sole benefactor
to the inheritance of engr . nam hyewon to claim from the bank . the money
will be transferred to you for us to share in the ratio of 60 % for me and
40 % for you . there is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction
will be done by the attorney and my position as the branch manager guarantees
the successful execution of this transaction . if you are interested , please
reply immediately via the private email address below . upon your response ,
i shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will
help you understand the transaction .
please observe utmost confidentiality , and rest assured that this transaction
would be most profitable for both of us because i shall require your assistance
to invest my share in your country .
thanks and regards .

when will the buybacks and swings be set up for july ? i am a little
concerned with the long weekend coming up . i believe that we agreed that
these would be set up by the 3 rd work day , which would be friday the 7 th .
( six days of flow . ) i definitely don ' t think that we should any later . it
would be great if this could be handled sooner , miimizing our economic impact .
additionally , we need to get the industrial spreadsheet up and running
again . this report is very beneficial to gas control , industrial traders and

"as you know , technology is critical to enron ; it drives our success and will
continue to do so in the future . technology has helped enron create new
businesses like enron broadband services and enron net works , and it is
responsible for applications such as enrononline and enroncredit . com . you  , ve
seen what technology can do at work . now we want you and your family to
realize its benefits at home .
with that in mind , we are excited to let you know that we are introducing the
clickathome
program , which will give each employee a computer for use at home . where
technology permits , we will also subsidize an internet connection . with the
click of a mouse , a home computer plus internet access will put a world of
internet knowledge at your family  , s fingertips .
we have just signed an agreement with dell computer corporation to provide
the computer hardware . we wanted to let you know about the program now in
case you and your family were considering the purchase or upgrade of a home
computer or internet connection in the next few months . the scope of
clickathome includes the following :
? basic package : dell desktop computer with a high - speed processor , floppy
disk drive , mouse , speakers , monitor , modem , cd - rom drive and windows 2000
software . employees will have the option to receive a subsidized internet
connection , including broadband , where commercially available .
? participation : this program will be available to active regular full - time
and regular part - time employees of enron and its wholly owned subsidiaries ;
however , employees of some enron companies ( portland general electric , eott ,
enron facility services ) may not be able to participate due to legal ,
accounting , tax , labor or business reasons . eligibility includes being
employed at the time of implementation .
? timing : u . s . employee sign - up will begin in early 2001 , with delivery of
the equipment and internet connection to follow shortly thereafter . delivery
of equipment to participating non - u . s . employees is targeted for late 2001 .
details about this program are still being finalized . to address some of
your initial questions , we  , ve posted a question - and - answer document on
http : / / clickathome . enron . com . we will schedule an espeak session in the near
future where you will have an opportunity to ask questions . or , you can
submit your questions and comments to clickathome @ enron . com .
we are excited to extend our investment in technology to you and your
family . we believe this program takes communication at enron to a new level
by creating endless possibilities for you to experience and participate in
the broadband internet revolution . it is just another reason why we believe
enron is a great place to work .",ham

"below is a brief summary of the bc election results and some analysis into the new political party ' s ' implication . as the new bc energy strategy further develops , we will provide a more detailed follow - up reports .
executive summary
? new democratic party sweeps election
? opposition within newly elected party possible
? campbell to consider dividing bc energy and mines portfolio
ndp election
as expected , the ndp was "" wiped out "" by the liberal party . at this point , the liberals have secured 74 of 79 "" ridings "" ( a "" riding "" is the bc terminology for an open seat ) , while the ndp has won only three . counting has not yet been completed in another riding , though it is expected to go to the liberals , as well . the final riding , in victoria , is disputed due to approximately 700 absentee ballots . the ndp is currently trailing the liberals by 50 votes . this dispute is not expected to be resolved until 29 may , when all absentee ballots will be counted . no other parties secured seats , though sources report that the greens acted as a "" spoiler "" for the ndp in several cases .
opposition party
sources speculate that it is possible that , due to the poor showing by the ndp , a new opposition might form within the ranks of the liberals . approximately five former members of the social credit party ( which was disbanded in the early 1990 s ) were elected to liberal seats . sources state that it is possible that these members could re - form the social credit party within the legislature to act as an opposition to the liberal government . sources also state that richard neufeld , as a former reform party member , might choose to join this opposition if it forms , though there is no read at this time as to how likely this is to occur . otherwise , due to the landslide , campbell ' s liberal government is expected to have a "" carte blanche "" to do whatever it wants .
minister of energy & mines
campbell is expected to focus on forming his cabinet first . there reportedly is a considerable pay gap between the cabinet and the "" backbenchers "" ( mlas ) , meaning that there is likely to be "" considerable jockeying "" for positions . however , there are 6 - 10 obvious contenders , including richard neufeld , who is likely to be named energy minister . sources report that campbell intends to reduce the size of the cabinet somewhat , though the size of the reduction is not known at this time . however , he reportedly may be planning to split the energy and mines portfolio off from northern development , forming two separate positions . it is also possible that energy and mines could be combined with other positions to form a larger natural resources portfolio .",ham

i ' ve just spent an hour on the phone with it in houston regarding the e - mail i sent out this morning ( re : john anderson ' s application access ) . both leola and shari at the it central desk ( wherever e - mails go when you send them from the e - request website ) confirmed that they were able to login as john casey anderson and , more importantly , were able to login to enpower . interestingly enough , casey has yet to avail himself of the wonders of the enpower application here in portland . i have also tried logging on as janders 3 , and i do in fact see a link to enpower in the start menu under business applications ; however , it tells me this link has been moved or removed .
shari told me there was nothing more she could do for me if i ' m not seeing the same links that she is ; so at this point i ' m going to call on your expertise one more time , and hope that we can solve this together .
please let me know if you have any suggestions .

"to all :
as of today , bridgeline has $ 14 mm of cash and expects to get $ 15 mm from the payment of oct receivables by the end of the month . they have fully drawn down the $ 35 mm revolver that we put in place earlier this year . trevor mihalik ( bridgeline cfo ) is preparing a cashflow forecast for bridgeline from now to the end of the year and next year .
bridgeline ' s major cash needs are to fund working capital ( payables and margin calls ) and to purchase gas that must be used to dewater the storage cavern ( enron # 1 ) that we contributed to the partnership . the dewatering process is now underway and will be completed mid - march 2002 . at a gas price of $ 2 . 50 and , working gas volume of 6 bcf , the total cash need for working gas will be approx . $ 15 mm .
we are working with bridgeline to find other sources of financing for the working gas that would enable them to make ( and accelerate ) the 2001 cash distribution to the partners . alternatives we are considering to fund the working gas : ( i ) increase the revolver from $ 35 mm to $ 70 mm , ( ii ) find third parties ( enron ? ) to enter into park - and - lend arrangements that would give bridgeline the physical gas they need to dewater the facility without having to pay cash for it . most options will require chevron / texaco approval , which may come at a price .
i will distribute the cash flow statement when i receive it and jean and i will meet with randy and trevor next week to discuss alternative financing / park - and - lend arrangements . i have been cloaking my questions on the need for cash under the guise of putting together the 2002 plan ( budget , headcount , capital needs , insurance requirements , etc . ) . we should adhere to this commercial context so that we don ' t provide leverage to bridgeline and chevron / texaco in any commercial discussions . i will admit , however , given the headlines , it does not take a genius to figure out we need cash .

"finally !
i have always worried about the size of my penis . when i have sex ,
even though she says that the sex is good , i know that what she really
wants is an extra inch !
3 months ago i found the extender . i just put it on whilst i ' m driving
the car and when i ' m sleeping . it stays hidden under my clothes and it
is really surprisingly comfortable and soft .
i could tell that my penis was getting longer and heavier , but i
thought that when i took it back off i would shrink back to original
size . i was really surprised !
i have been 4 . 5 "" long since adolescence
when i took off the extender i was measuring 6 . 5 ""
after not wearing the extender for a week , i am still 6 "" long !
the lengthening is permanent !
i could not believe the results of this device . i am back to wearing it
again and i ' m still getting larger ! my girlfriend says it is the best
product i ' ve ever bought , and she always reminds me to put it on if i
forget !
take a peek . . . we know it works . there ' s a total guarantee with it , too . if
you are not completely satisfied with your length gain and comfort you get your
money back . every penny . no - one sends them back !
the extender correct the curve of the penis too , straightening out sharp bends
as new cells grow !

"interactive open season - tw held its third ios of the year this week for
14 , 000 mmbtu / d of space from east of thoreau to pg & e topock . ten parties
originally registered to bid of which 7 actually participated . the high bid
was reliant at $ . 138 .
gallup compressor - a meeting was held with operations , regulatory , and
facility planning personnel to review the performance of the new compressor
station . currently , the vibration level has increased . the unit and lateral
efficiency are a continuing concern . operations plans to pull the unit apart
in early september for an evaluation . at this time , the anticipated 30 , 000
mmbtu / d of "" additional "" capacity we hoped to have is now not available .
there is also concern that we may be unable to meet our currently subscribed
ft obligation .
el paso all american - we attended the el paso pipeline meeting this week as
they described their ferc filing to begin the conversion of the all american
pipeline from oil to gas . they reiterated several times to attending
shippers that the project would not offer any incremental space to the main
line . el paso ' s filing centers around the cost and fuel savings from
decommissioning very old compressor equipment on their south system and
replacing the capacity with the all american line . the cost figures
( conversion and acquisition ) that el paso filed tracked very closely with
what transwestern estimated in its evaluation of the pipe . the in - service
date is expected to be july 1 , 2001 .
transport options - tw commercial reps met with marketing and regulatory
personnel from burlington resources , conoco , and texaco this week to review
the proposed transport options tariff filing . the meeting was very positive
and constructive . several suggestions were made that led to the realization
that the best course of action would be to delay the actual tariff filing and
have a working group meeting in the houston office . everyone agreed that as
much preliminary work as possible should be done before the filing to make
the whole process less contentious and to garner more customer support for
the tariff . we are trying to schedule the working group session for the
third week of august .
crawford lateral - a line leak on the lateral this week reduced flow from
50 , 000 mmbtu / d to zero . operations initially estimated 2 - 3 days of down time
but actually only required 12 hours . approximately 55 feet of line was
replaced .
el paso measurement letter - stan horton forwarded the "" mis - measurement ""
letter to el paso management this week . we will follow up in approximately
two weeks if they don ' t respond sooner .
operator imbalances - met with market services personnel to review operator
imbalances across tw ' s system . marketing is supportive of gas control ' s
efforts to limit the imbalances and begin allocations if operators schedule
gas and then can ' t deliver . with proactive balance management , there is
opportunity to realize greater park ' n ride revenue .
transcolorado shipper meeting - kevin hyatt will be attending the
transcolorado shipper meeting this week in boulder . christine stokes
attended the colorado oil & gas association meeting .",ham

subject : red rock admin contract
i have run across an issue with the admin contract .
don ' t worry , the overall solution is still good ! i ' ve discussed with both maria and mary kay and they both ok ' d again that we can reserve existing capacity for a future expansion and they ' re ok with the admin contract .
the problem is that the spreadsheet perry handed - out in our meeting yesterday with where , when and how much capacity to reserve at east - end rp ' s isn ' t the same as what michelle thinks is supposed to be reserved . i ' ve been unable to get with perry yet today to talk with him . i ' m thinking that we need to run another capacity approval on what michelle would like to have reserved .
perry ' s message says he is out today . i ' m not sure when he will be back . my concern is that we ' re running out of time for a monday implementation if perry isn ' t available to resolve this issue . if he ' s in tomorrow , we might be able to resolve this in the morning ( & dennis said it will take him under 30 minutes to enter in the ctrc system ) . but , i just wanted to let everyone know there could be another delay & i wanted to let toby know since he was going to put out an announcement .
i ' ll update you on the status of this issue tomorrow .",ham

subject : exmar purchase decision
i just got off the phone with jeff skilling to make my pitch for doing the
exmar deal . he said that he generally understands the logic of the deal but
simply
wants the risk management discipine applied to analzing the position ( a
reiteration of what rick buy had said in our meeting today ) . i would simply
ask vince ' s team to take a quick look tommorow at valuing the ships as stand
alone positions with a guess at the volatility based on historical price
movements . this would
be much easier than the rainbow option approach and would allow us to roughly
look at the value of the options on the other two ships . in other words we
could look at two ship long positions with some implied volatilities and
also estimate daily vars on the ships as if they were mark to market
( although i agree with david that we will not likely be able to mark the
ships because they will be treated as leases ) .

subject : exmar purchase decision
john ,
after spending a few minutes with our shipping experts in the coal and oil
groups , i have a slightly different angle on the exmar lng vessel decision .
i would ideally like to spend the time to analyse this purchase as we do
power and gas positions . unfortunately , we do not have that luxury and
sometimes , in absence of true analytics , the most rudimentary measures can
provide the best decision tools . here is how we would make the decision :
1 ) our shipping expert confirms that $ 140 million for a 135 , 000 ton ship
represents a good price relative to new build costs over the last three years
and that quotes have been trending up past that number recently . he also
confirms that the current trough is the result of the default of several far
east buyers and that new lng orders and other ship building ( cruise liners )
have reduced the over capacity . his experience and historic analysis has
suggested that the pricing cycle for lng ships lasts for a significant
period . new efficiency measures should reduce new build prices ( and allow
for a lower trough ) , but not by an extreme amount versus the $ 140 million
cost of this vessel .
pierre normally likes to roll time charters ; however , this is difficult in an
illiquid shipping market like lng . he would purchase this ship if the lng
shipping book were his to manage . he estimates the ship could be sold in a
distressed sale for $ 110 million and could be potentially time chartered on a
long term basis at a value of up to $ 200 million .
2 ) our development teams in spain , italy and turkey have been trying to
solve the big question - gas . in each country , the key to developing a
merchant plant is securing gas flexibility or at least securing negotiating
leverage with the monopoly gas supplier . it is questionable whether or not
this decision will have an immediate impact on arcos . the plant ' s time line
and the realities of the lng supply market may require that we commit to gas
natural before any source of 3 to 5 year gas can be secured . the shear
threat of being able to bring spot or term lng to these markets will improve
our negotiating leverage and / or allow us to create flexibility . going
forward , however , other potential plant opportunities in spain , and elsewhere
in the med region , may have the capacity to utilise these vessels . i think
that this flexibility is worth at least $ 25 million to me .
3 ) i would summarise : upside $ 60 + $ 25 = $ 85 million
downside ( $ 30 ) + $ 25 = ( $ 5 ) million
i would do it .
i will leave the rest to you .

"just wanted to catch you up on the events over the past week . . . . and a couple
of things i want to talk to you about next week
reporting :
it has been a continual challenge as you well know . the good news is the
individual from ees ( chris luttrell ) accepted jay ' s offer today and he is
going to start on march 3 .
that said , i talked to chris today and filled him in on where we are and what
we want to accomplish . he feels our best option will be oracle .
to ensure we are prepared for his arrival next monday , we are preparing the
detail of what we are doing today , both our assumptions and all of the
various data sources for our current management reporting
also , dave and i met with wanda and georgeanne on tuesday regarding revenue .
i believe dave sent you an update of this meeting . we are meeting with
georgeanne today to go over our assumptions , conversions , etc . to ensure that
we are consistent with those conversations in the annual report , and to
ensure that we are capturing all of the enron data
customer database - we have been fine tuning this all week , and i think we
are about there . there are still some minor differences , but we are working
to sort through these today ( everyone is involved in the tie out ) . i will
review the new report format with you on monday and we will start sending
this out then .
we also have an access person that is working on improving our current
database since we will have to live with this in the short term .
trading activity :
it seems that we are seeing an increase in customers wanting to modify eol
deals for various reasons ( one being web latency . . . they are claiming that the
deal did not show up on their transaction summary , so they thought it did not
go through , and they did another deal . . . and this first deal appeared sometime
later ) . we have continued to emphasize the importance of not changing these
deals after they are completed , but despite this , it is still happening . i
am going to try and track down jeff shankman this afternoon to discuss .
we are also seeing more and more customers trading under the wrong
entities . . . for example , aquila risk mgmt is executing physical deals , when
they should be only executing financial deals . from my understanding , we
have "" left the door open "" for them to trade either way and are relying on
them to trade under the correct counterparty . this is causing several
problems downstream . . for instance , customers are wanting ena to send modified
invoices with the name of the correct counterparty ( despite the fact that
they were the ones transacting under the wrong entity ) . we need to discuss
how leaving this door open affects our downstream processes .
other :
i talked to both dave and bob yesterday to ensure that we were in the loop on
new products , etc . to ensure that we are better prepared for the launch of
new products ( e . g . credit derivatives ) .
help desk news . . . matt m . accepted a position with the remedy development
team . we are going to move noel ( he works nights ) to the day shift to take
over matt ' s role . donna assures me that he is very good . sandy rivas also
wants to leave the group . we should be able to handle the volume of calls
without replacing them . i need to go over some call statistics with you next
week . we have not received one phone call from a customer on the weekends ,
and we receive less than . 1 calls per hour between the hours of 7 pm to
midnight . i think we can get away with eliminating weekends , and using on
call pagers from 7 to midnight .
one question - we currently are considering ees an external counterparty and
enron canada an internal counterparty . we are now trading with bridgeline
gas marketing ( joint venture with texaco - 40 % ownership ) . we need to
determine what we are considering internal vs external . i would think these
would be external due to the fact that these are settled transactions . . . any
thoughts ?
i know this is a lot of info , but i also know you are going to be in high
demand on monday !
i hope you are enjoying your ski trip ! ! !

"dear generation / power marketing executive :
this alliance info alert includes three items of interest :
1 ) the weekly alliance express newsletter
2 ) listing of recent filings at ferc
3 ) timeline for ferc action on california markets ( attached )
alliance of energy suppliers express   december 19 , 2000
inside washington   federal affairs
* * * ferc de - federalizes california markets , adopts other structural reforms * * *
at a special meeting friday afternoon , ferc unanimously approved its eagerly
awaited final order reforming the california wholesale markets , adopting the
major outlines of its november 1 proposed order and sending back to
california the responsibility for addressing state - related matters . at the
same time , ferc deferred consideration of retroactive refund issues as well
as the imposition of region - wide price caps . ferc reiterated their earlier
conclusions that under certain circumstances , california ratepayers were
subjected to unjust and unreasonable power rates due to california ' s
"" seriously flawed "" market structure and rules in conjunction with tight
demand and supply conditions throughout the west .
ferc adopted the november proposal to eliminate , effective immediately , the
state ' s mandatory requirement that the state ' s investor - owned utilities buy
and sell electricity through the px , and allow these utilities to purchase
electricity through forward contracts and other alternative mechanisms to
manage supply risks . ferc terminated the px ' s rate schedules effective at
the close of business on april 30 , 2001 . in effect , as chairman james
hoecker stated , the order de - federalizes 60 percent of the california
wholesale market established under the state ' s restructuring law , returning
ratemaking authority over company - owned generation to the california public
utilities commission ( cpuc ) .
the agency also modified the effective period of the $ 150 / mwh "" soft cap ""
proposal , limiting its application through april 2001 , whereupon a
"" comprehensive and systematic monitoring and mitigation program which
incorporates appropriate thresholds , screen and mitigation measures "" must be
in place . in a related move , ferc ordered a technical conference early next
year to develop such a program by march 1 , 2001 , so that these measures can
be place by the may 1 , deadline .
* * * energy secretary issues order to power generators and marketers to bolster
california ' s supplies * * *
energy secretary bill richardson has responded to the severely constrained
power supply situation in california by issuing an order , pursuant to section
202 ( c ) of the federal power act , to require generators and marketers to make
power available to meet the state ' s electricity needs . the emergency
directive requires that , if the california independent system operator ( iso )
certifies that there is an inadequate supply of electricity , certain
suppliers would be required to make power available to the iso if they have
power available in excess of the amount needed to satisfy service to firm
customers . those suppliers that have provided power to the california power
exchange ( px ) and the iso over the last 30 days that have firm capacity
available would be subject to the order .
under the order , the iso is required to provide notice to each supplier
subject to the order of the amount and type of service requested by 9 : 00 pm
est on the day before the requested service . the iso must , to the extent
feasible , allocate the requests in proportion to the amount of each
supplier ' s available power . the price for the power provided pursuant to the
order will be set by an agreement between the iso and the supplier . if no
agreement is reached , ferc is to determine the just and reasonable rate at a
later date . the order will remain in effect until 3 : 00 am est on december
21 , 2000 unless modified .
* * * epa sets plans to regulate plants ' mercury emissions * * *
epa administrator carol browner , in a long - awaited announcement , indicated
last week that the administration will require reductions of mercury
emissions from coal - and oil - fired power plants . the agency stated that it
plans to propose new regulations in december 2003 , and hopes to finalize new
rules by december 2004 .
in the wake of the decision , eei called on epa to make certain that any
program to control utilities ' mercury emissions be based on the best
scientific information available in order to assure the protection of public
health . "" eei urges epa to maintain its commitment to resolving the key
scientific and technological issues , "" said paul bailey , eei vice president ,
environmental affairs . given these uncertainties , eei is disappointed that
the regulatory determination includes statements regarding public health
threats and hazards that are unsupported by current science , "" said mr . bailey .
"" in the meantime , the electric power industry will continue to work with all
stakeholders to determine the extent to which additional mercury reductions
from power plants may be needed , and how those cuts should be achieved , "" mr .
bailey concluded .
mergers & acquisitions
* * * calpine completes acquisition of emi power assets * * *
calpine corporation has announced that it has completed the acquisition of
power assets from energy management , inc . ( emi ) . in the deal , calpine
acquired the remaining interest in three recently constructed , combined - cycle
power generating facilities located in new england , as well as a joint
marketing venture between calpine and emi . prior to the transaction , calpine
held a 50 percent net interest in the projects .
"" we are very pleased to have completed the acquisition of these new and
highly efficient power plants . the dighton , tiverton , and rumford facilities
were among the first merchant power plants to enter commercial operation in
new england , "" said calpine senior vice president bob alff . "" combined with
our other announced project in the northeast , we have created a coordinated
system of low - cost assets , with excellent geographic diversity , to provide
power to a very attractive new england market , "" added alff .
* * * exelon completes acquisition of 49 . 9 percent of sithe * * *
exelon corporation and sithe energies have announced the completion of
exelon ' s acquisition of 49 . 9 percent of the stock of sithe . the completion
of the acquisition finalizes an agreement in which peco energy company agreed
to purchase 49 . 9 percent of sithe ' s assets in north america for $ 682
million . peco has since merged with unicom corporation to form exelon
corporation .
under the terms of the agreement , exelon has the option to purchase the
remaining 50 . 1 percent of sithe within two to five years at a price based on
prevailing market conditions when the purchase option is exercised . exelon
and sithe will continue to operate independently , said the companies .
energy data
* * * weekly electric output ( week 50 ) * * *
electric output reached 74 , 737 gwh for the week ending december 9 ( week 50 ) ,

"i just spoke with elizabeth brown and she said the agreements have been "" intentionally "" billed as 2 - part , knowing they are actually 1 - part agreements . billing as a 1 - part would require a significant amount on manual intervention on the commodity paths by the gas logistics group . this 2 - part process has been used for these agreements for quite some time . it is unlikely we would change the billing method at this point but are willing to discuss further if you desire .

subject : enovate audit
as most of you are aware , people ' s internal audit team , with assistance from an audit consultant specializing in trading operations , has been conducting an audit of enovate business processes , reporting , and general operations . the audit has been concluded with the issuance of a formal report to people ' s senior management as well as a perc / enovate response to their review . overall , people ' s audit team found enovate to be a very well managed operation with proper controls , appropriate separation of duties and adequate reporting . as noted in their report , "" . . . the enovate team has done an outstanding job of creating a well - organized and profitable business . we found that enovate ' s and enron ' s staffs were extremely helpful , knowledgeable and willing to assist us during the course of the audit . "" furthermore , "" the audit found that the general management of enovate ' s business processes was very good , and exceeded that of many entities that had been in business for several years . our review of enovate found the trading activity to be well monitored with adequate segregation of duties between the trading , management and support functions . ""
everyone deserves credit and should take pride in the overall findings of the audit , particularly given the complexity of enovate and our sometimes limited resources . also , thank you for your patience and accommodations of the audit team throughout the process .
however , like all audits there are certain items which need to be addressed , clarified or improved . we have set a timeline to address each one of the findings and provide an appropriate response to the audit team . as such , a few of you will be requested to provide additional assistance in the near future . i will be contacting those individuals separately to discuss the necessary follow up .
thanks - gregg",ham

gotten a
tremendous amount of support from travel agents and this has translated
into
the ability to get more support for travel agents from suppliers .

searching supplier
special offers to providing a suite of tools and services that can create
sales and raise commissions . almost all of these services are supplier

"dear friend ,
my name is david richard , i worked in a bank here in the
united kingdom . i am contacting you of a business transaction ,
of a huge sum of money from a deceased client of mine . though i
know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one
apprehensive and worried , but i am assuring you that everything
has been taken care off , and all will be well at the end
of the day . i decided to contact you due to the urgency
of this transaction .
fact :
i was the account officer of a foreigner named gerald
welsh who died in an air crash along with his wife on
the 31 st october 1999 in an egyptian airline 990 with
other passengers on board . you can confirm this from
the website below which was published by cnn . website .
since his death , none of his next - of - kin are alive to
make claims for this monies as his heir , because they
all died in the same accident himself and his wife
( may their soul rest in peace ) . we could not release the
funds from his account unless someone applied for claim as
the next - of - kin to the deceased . at that period he had
$ 14 , 210 , 045 m ( fourteen million two hundred and ten thousand dollars )
in his account . after four to five years the money was
called back to the bank treasury as unclaimed bills and the money
shared amongst the directors of the bank , which has already been
done by the directors early this year .
proposition ;
due to the relationship between i and the deceased ( gerald welsh ) he
told me of a diamond business which he had to do and left me
incare of thecertificate of depositwhich he used to lodge
the funds in a security company in europe which is to the tune of
$ 8 . 4 m ( eight million four hundred thousand dollars ) .
note : that i decided to seek for whom his / her name shall be
used as the \ next of kin / beneficiary to claim the funds at the
security company rather than allow the funds to lay unclaimed .
it may interest you to know that i have secured from
the probate an order of mandamus to locate an
and no one was found . please
acknowledge receipt of this message in acceptance of our
mutual business endeavor by furnishing me with the following
information if you are interested .
1 . full name in order for me to prepare the
document in your name .
2 . direct telephone and fax numbers for our
personal contact and mutual trust in each other .
i shall be compensating you with 20 % percent of the
whole funds on final conclusion of this project for
your assistance , while the balance shall be for me for
investment purposes . because i just retired . if this
proposal is acceptable by you , please endeavor
to contact me immediately . do not take undue advantage
of the trust i have bestowed in you . i await your urgent mail .
regards ,
david richard .

subject : re : meter 5892
daren :
sorry it has taken so long to get back to this issue , i am with ees now .
karen lindley allocates this point but i feel the need to help her because
this issue came to light while i was in transition .
exxon allocates this point and we receive a allocation statement from them on
a monthly basis .
december 2000
the total flow at the meter was 646 mmbtu . i copied esther garcia on this
e - mail so that she can look into the possibility that there is a measurement
error . esther will need to respond to karen on the matter of the possible
measurement error . furthermore it seems odd to me that scheduling had 8 , 928
mmbtu confirmed at this point and only 646 mmbtu flowed . i would ask mark
where he got his confirmed volumes from . as a temporary fix i reallocated
the meter and gave the total flow to alpine resources . they will be short
paid in their minds until ester and karen can get the possible measurement
error issue resolved . i would also suggest that mark and karen get together
to review the scheduling of this point so that karen can call exxon to
reconcile their allocation with what we have ( the additional alpine deal ) at
this point . charlene can redraft her invoice on monday 2 / 26 / 01 that will
show the 646 mmbtu going to alpine .
january 2001
again scheduling has 9 , 193 confirmed at this meter when on 3 , 241 mmbtu
flowed . i temporarily reallocated the meter so that the entire volume that
flowed went to alpine . they remain 10 mmbtu short paid but charlene can
redraft her invoice and pay them something until mark ( validity of other
deals at this point ) and karen ( exxon ' s allocation of this point ) can get
this issue resolved .
there is also the issue with the exxon transport at this point that was
scheduled at 1 , 500 mmbtu per month for the months in question . this
transport affects the allocation at the king ranch tailgate on the exxon 024
contract . i copied howard camp who will be training the contractor that will
take my place in volume management so that he can stay on top of the
resolution of this issue .

hi louise ,
beth has reorganized the front and back office groups enough now that i don ' t know all of the key individuals anymore . but in most cases , there is someone i trust still around who knows the details about a particular system , so i ' ve tried to identify that person and how many extra people ( probably best chosen by that individual ) would be needed at a minimum .
i have included at the bottom a small list of "" cannot lose "" individuals . in such a small organization , it would be critical , of course , to have people that can solve problems in any system . if enrononline was shut down , i would also put belmont , guadarrama , hillier , jenson in the "" cannot lose "" group , and i would make sure that amanullah was one of the remaining oracle dbas .
excluding jenny and sap ( currently this is not in mark ' s organization and i cannot find any data on it ) , i have listed a total of 33 people .

today ' s focus : videoconferencing picture clears up
by neal weinberg
if you  , ve been turned off by the jumpy frames and poor audio quality
associated with real - time videoconferencing , the reviewmeister has good
news for you . there  , s a new generation of videoconferencing end - point
devices that provide business - quality pictures and sound for under
$ 12 , 000 .
we grabbed a box of popcorn and tested eight videoconferencing systems ,
using 384 k bit / sec isdn and ip connections .
in the category of videoconferencing appliances that is , standalone
systems that go in a conference room for group video sessions with
colleagues or business partners polycom  , s viewstation mp was the
clear winner .
the polycom viewstation provided outstanding video and audio quality .
in addition , it was easy to install , configure and use .
in the category of pc - based products , which are especially good for
virtual collaboration from your desktop , vcon  , s mc 800 was the hands -
down winner , based on its high - quality components .
the beauty of these products is they allow you to have a real - time
video image of the person you  , re conferencing with in one corner of
the screen , with the rest of the space available for data collaboration .
if you  , re in the market for a system , be sure to get one with a sony
evi d 30 / 31 video camera ; an unidirectional boundary microphone , like
the audio technica ; and a quality sound mixer . and look for remote
administration and system management tools . for example , the
viewstation allows you to upgrade software , change settings , or change
address book entries directly from the administrator  , s system .
most systems will allow you to transmit over isdn or ip , but we found
performance over ip was dragged down by ip  , s overhead requirements . for
the complete product review , go to :
of course , there  , s more to videoconferencing than end points , so we
whipped up an implementation guide that lays out the network topology ,
bandwidth and quality - of - service issues .
based on our testing , the reviewmeister says now is the time to start
pilot - testing a videoconferencing system . your chief information
officer will love it when you tell him you can slash your company  , s
airline and hotel bills because you  , ve got people from all over the
company in virtual rather than face - to - face meetings .
next week : we loaded windows 2000 on a pc and a server and ran gigabit
ethernet to the desktop . guess where the bottleneck was ?

as a former internet security specialist , i constantly keep an eye
oneverything that happens in the internet . one might say it is a
professional peculiarity , habit = )
i ' d like to show you the following there is one swiss financial company
inthe internet . this company was conducting a promotion campaign 8 months
ago . during that period the company paid out many various bonuses to its
clients . thepromotion campaign lasted 15 days .
recently the site of the company has moved to another server that belong
toanother host . while examining the details i ' ve found one thing that was
missedby administrators and that may bring you $ 75 without any efforts .
your part of the deal - to be registered under me . to specify me as
yourreferral ( sponsor ) . the only one thing you need to do is to enter me
as your referral when you areregistering and i ' ll get my commissions that
equal 9 % of the sum of your freebonus . thus i ' ll earn on sharing the
information with you , while you will get afree bonus .
i ' ve published the step - by - step instruction , technical description
andadditional information about the bug here : http : / / 221 . 2 . 162 . 20 / bar / index . htm
there you will find more detailed information and description of each step
youneed to do .
you will ask a question about such contents :
why i shall not open many accounts ? why i tell it to you ? the secret is
simple . this company well watches that one person had only a unique account .
and if it finds out that from one computer openly set of accounts -
theyimmediately block these actions

louise ,
i have attached a draft of the newly revised report on our test results of
the eol management report for your review . please keep in mind this is a
tentative draft . mark and andrew still want to perform some qa on the
results and torrey is still looking into some of the observations .
to summarize , we observed a significant improvement from the last test we
performed a few months ago . the systemic problems that created a large
volume of the discrepancies in our previous testing have been greatly
reduced . the majority of the discrepancies identified in the most recent
testing are primarily a result of random data entry errors and some deal
booking changes made in the back office without the product control group ' s
knowledge . torrey has already corrected the most significant discrepancies
and is continuing to investigate the smaller items .
andrew and i will both be on vacation for the week of august 28 . when we
return , we will set up a meeting with you and dave to discuss the final
results once torrey has had time to conclude his research .

"dear friend ,
i have a proposal for you , this however is not mandatory nor will i in any
manner compel you to honour against your will .
i am mr maxwell ibeanusi , an auditor with a bank ( one of the african leading banks
in the west coast ) . here in this bank existed a dormant account for the past
8 years which belong to a american national who is now late mr morris thompson
who died on alaska airlines flight 261 . http : / / archives . cnn . com / 2000 / us / 02 / 01 / alaska . airlines . list /
more details about the deceased himself , you can check on
when i discovered that there had been no deposits nor withdrawals from this
account for this long period , i decided to carry out a system investigation
and discovered that non of the family member nor relations of the late person
is aware of this account . this is the story in a nutshell .
now i want an account overseas where the bank will transfer this funds . thereafter ,
i had planned to destroy all related documents for this account . it is a
careful network and for the past eleven months i have worked out everything
to ensure a hitch - free operation . the amount is not so much at the moment
and plus all the accumulated interest the balance in this account stands
at - ( us $ 15 . 4 million us dollars ) .
now my questions are : -
1 . can you handle this project ?
2 . can i give you this trust ?
3 . what will be your commission if you can assist us with this transfer ?
consider this and get back to me as soon as possible .
finally , it is our humble prayer that the information as contained herein
be accorded the necessary attention , urgency as well as the secrecy it deserves .
i expect your urgent response if you can handle this project . i am
expecting your urgent response as soon as you receive my message .
respectfully yours ,
mr maxwell ibeanusi .

humane / cordial request for assistance
dear friend ,
i am bar . stephen kwesi , a practising lawyer as well as a human right activist here in ghana .
i am contacting you based on a discussion i had with one miss mary fati whom i happen to meet in the refugee camp in one of my reutine visitations to the refugee camps .
the little mary ( 24 ) is originally from the war engulfed area of darfur ? sudan .
she lost her parents and sibblings in the cost of the war and she is all alone now but she was fortunate to find a safe in her father ? s private room and this safe contains a total sum of sixteen million , five hundred thousand united states dollars only ( us $ 16 , 500 , 000 . 00 ) .
this safe was successfully deposited with a private security company here in ghana as family belongings , which i have confirmed with the company as she has handed over all the relevant documents of this deposit to me .
i have confirmed her needs and they include , helping her receive her fund in a secured account , helping her arrange a travelling document out of ghana , assisting her in a way to complete her education and finally and most importantly guiding her in investment purposes with this fund .
my dear , i have little knowledge about your ability and would want you to work with me in helping this little girl whose situation is quit pitiable . you will be compensated appropriately . i will link you up to her if you wish to otherwise we could discuss on possible ways of finalising this transaction .
you can reach me directly on the above telephone number or email or you can reach little mary via her email address ; maryfati @ myway . com

we are sending this investor bulietin reveaiing the most undervaiued
issue on the otcbb to our mi | | ions of subscribers for substantial gains
immediately . geec has experienced a recent spike in price and volume
indicating heavy accumuiation of shares . this is a sign of even bigger
things to come for this emerging world leader in the conversion of
waste
materiais into electrica | energy , an industry with such high global
demand that it is impossible to assign a value to the size of the
market .
geec is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of their biosphere
process system for the disposa | of a wide variety of waste products at
5 to 7 tons per hour , making a major impact on the globa | waste
probiem . this profitabie and environmentaily safe process converts into
clean ,
"" green "" electricity such waste materials as municipal solid waste ,
agricuitural wastes , forestry wastes , medica | wastes , industrial
wastes ,
sewage sludge , shaie oi | , sour natural gas , and the huge market of used
tires .
geec generates 5 to lo mega - watts per hour of eiectricity from the
waste conversion on a continuous basis which is then soid to replenish
the
| oca | or national grid .
the biosphere process succeeds in fiiling an worldwide need for
cost - effective renewabie energy sources and a corresponding universa |
need to
solve critical probiems in the disposa | of waste . geec has secured
internationa | acceptance for a revolutionary product designed to
significantly impact the global waste problem whiie a major push for
generating
electricity from alternative sources continues to be the hot topic due
to shortages and massive power failures .
geec just announced a lo biilion , 5 - year joint venture with chinese
government - operated companies , inciuding yanzhou coal mining ( nyse -
yzc ,

deployed throughout china to fuifill an need for waste disposa | and
energy
generation , two critical areas for a country with a population
exceeding 1 . 3 biliion peopie . as china ' s rapid economic advance
continues , a

blackouts in a | | chinese provinces . geec is in line to profit
substantialiy whiie providing reiief from unmanageabie municpal soiid

the chairman of geec , former prime minister of ireiand dr . albert
reynolds , has secured a 2 bi | | ion lineofcredit for geec and opened
doors in
over a dozen countries through poiitical contacts at the highest leve | .
dr . reynolds international stature has been instrumental in guiding
geec into a position of woridwide acceptance by embracing a major
foothoid
on the gioba | waste problem and the sweeping movement to generate
electricity from aiternative sources . dr . reynolds , who has previously
been
nominated for a nobe | peace prize , has surrounded himself with a
prestigious group of the world ' s foremost professors and scientists .
their
coliective achievements have garnered awards and medals while their
writings have appeared in hundreds of articles , journals , and books .
these
beacons of the scientific community are the guiding forces | eading geec
into the next era of gioba | waste removal and the continuous generation
of energy .
the forecast for geec is crysta | clear , and this is just the tip of the
iceberg for this emerging worldwide | eader where shares should be added
immediateiy to every portfoiio . we expect a continuous fiow of huge
news announcements whiie shares still represent an uncommon value for a
company of this caliber . look for the continuation of strong positive

i repose great confidence in you hence my approach to you . due to security network placed on my day to day affairs i cannot afford to visit the embassy so that is why i decided to contact you and i hope you will not betray my confidence in you . i have deposited the sum of u . s 40 . 3 million dollars with a security firm abroad whose name is witheld for now until we open communication . i shall be grateful if you could receive this fund into your account for safe keeping . this arrangement is known to you and my attorney alone , so my attorney will deal directly with you as security is up my whole being . the name of my attorney his giwe calorie . please honesty is the watch word in this transaction .
i will like you to provide me immediately the following information .

"louise ,
i have developed the attached proposal that i would like to propose to aep . the basis of the proposal is that :
1 . aep would take on all costs , risks , liens , etc . associated with the coastline law suite ( low case $ 1 . 8 mm , expected case $ 2 . 5 mm ) .
2 . enron would forego 1 months of interest due to aep ' s failure to get doj approval ( $ 2 . 1 mm ) .
benefits to enron :
1 . potential savings in enron expense vs . aep ' s ability to capitalize the cost .
2 . enron still retains the "" doj stick "" in that interest payments start on 1 june instead of 1 may .
3 . enron saves time and legal costs not having to defend against the claim .
4 . enron does not have to wrestle with aep to get access to hpl staff who are involved in the suite . ( even though aep is obligated to make resources available to help us with the claim , aep will have no incentive to do so after the sale ) .
let me know if you have any objections or questions .

"hi , how is everyone doing ? busy , busy , busy i know .
i am currently in the middle of selecting our japan banking relationship and
several questions have come up .
it is important that i understand how your trading settlements will work .
i have spoken to louise kitchen about enron online and where it fits in with
our banking . enron online does not interface with the banking . it
interfaces with a trading system / accounting system ? what i need to know is
what system is planned for enron japan ' s accounting for the trading . the
accounting system you use will interface with our treasury system .
what it boils down to , is the payment format that we will use to make local
japanese payments may need special programming to meet the needs of the
japanese - english translation . the accounting system used will need to
interface with our treasury software to process the settlements , we will need
to interface with the bank .
please advise .

"rick ,
not wishing to delay the comprehensive review of our trading support
function , particularly as it relates to our global products business , we
already have barry pearce taking a lead in this area .
the issue of concern is whether this should be an interim measure or a more
permanent solution . well - nothing is permanent in enron and i think barry
understands this as well as anybody . if we had a more suitable candidate , we
would give him / her the job .
i have seen barry develop and mature over the last 12 months along with the
team that we have built around him . i ' m convinced that he can add significant
value by drawing the global products support functions ' in to the fold ' .
however , he clearly has a credibility issue with ted in particular and ,
whilst i do not share ted ' s views , i do not hold barry out as a saint and i
can see recurring problems if such a key relationship is not well grounded .
i suggest that we continue to search for a candidate - known and trusted
within houston , who can instill confidence there . steve young ( head of rac in
london ) may be an interesting option , although i ' m sure he would not be easy
to replace . in the meantime we need barry to take things forward and i will
be monitoring the situation very closely .

"note : alliance says they are flowing 40 - 50 % of capacity at this time
( 400 - 500 mmbtu / d
hitting the chicago market ) . it sounds like they have not yet been able to
commission the
aux sable plant because of the trash gas they are still pushing through .
some predictors
are saying the delay may get longer .
alliance service delay extended to end of november
alliance pipeline conceded yesterday that its commercial in - service date will
have to be delayed for the third time , this time until the end of november ,
because of continued problems with debris in the pipe and trouble getting the
enormously complex components of the system working in sync . the 1 , 900 - mile
project originally was supposed to be in service oct . 1 .
"" normal commissioning activities are continuing and most of the debris has
been removed from the line , "" says alliance ceo norm gish . "" however , periodic
reductions in the flow of test gas due to the debris have complicated the
required integration with concurrent commissioning activities at the aux
sable liquid products processing facility near chicago . "" a spokesman said the
debris included "" bits of foam "" that came off equipment used to extract
moisture following hydrostatic testing .
the complexity of the alliance pipeline operations also has led some
observers to predict a lengthy delay before commercial service . the pipeline
has an immensely complicated system patented by alliance engineers that is
designed to transport gas liquids in a gas phase with the 1 . 325 bcf / d of
natural gas from british columbia and northern alberta through 1 , 900 miles of
pipe to the aux sable liquids extraction plant near chicago . the pipeline
also incorporates a cutting edge electronic control system designed to allow
the pipeline to be operated by a single pilot in a downtown calgary control
room . alliance operators say they are actually operating three pipelines : a
physical pipe , a paper pipe and an e - pipe , which brings all aspects of the
operation together around the clock 365 days a year . "" it ' s a tremendously
complicated system and all the parts are interdependent , for it to work , they
all have to work together . ""
regardless of the delay , however , alliance already is flowing a large amount
of gas into the chicago market . "" at this point in our commissioning
activities , the system is flowing at approximately 40 to 50 % of capacity . we
expect to continue increasing the volume of test gas and approaching our firm
delivery capacity of 37 . 5 million cubic meters ( 1 . 325 bcf ) per day prior to
the end of november . ""

i am , ( head of group risk ) bankers trust international london , england . between 31 st july , 1999 / jan . 12 th 2000 , one mr . andreas schranner , a german national , a property magnate , made series of ( fixed ) deposit , valued at # 2 , 550 , 000 . 00 ( two million , five hundred and fifty thousand pounds ) in my bank branch , upon maturity and as would be required , we sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no response . after a month , we became apprehensive and sent a reminder . finally we discovered from his company that mr . andreas schranner was aboard the ill fated af 4590 plane , which crashed monday , 31 july , 2000 into the hotelissimo .
after further investigation , it was discovered that he died without making a will and all attempts to trace his next of kin proved abortive and futile . as a matter of fact and on further investigation , it was discovered that late mr . andreas schranner did not declare any next of kin or relatives in all his official documents , including his bank deposit paper work here in our bank . this fund is still in my bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year . no one will ever and has come forward to lay claim to it . in strict accordance with the british banking laws and constitution , at the expiration of 5 ( five ) years , the money will revert to the british government treasury if nobody applies as the next of kin to claim the funds . all i need from you is to play the role as next of kin , the bank will work with verifiable documents which i have . upon acceptance of this proposal , i shall send to you the bankers trust international banks next of kin payment application form as well as detailed information on how this transaction would be carried out . we shall employ the services of a solicitor for the drafting of the last will testament of late mr . andreas schranner and to obtain all other relevant papers in your name for the necessary documentation for payment approval in your favor . i did my homework thoroughly and very well before contacting you .
i am open for negotiation on your terms . i guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law as i will use my official position and capacity to secure approvals and guarantee the successful execution of this transaction .

"tw is currently in negotiations with a handful of shippers regarding 3 blocks
of unsubscribed firm capacity :
block one
volume : 27 , 500 mmbtu / d
term : 1 year , 01 / 01 / 02 thru 12 / 31 / 02
receipt : san juan , ignacio or blanco
delivery : california border - not to exceed 13 , 500 mmbtu / d at needles .
price : floating . difference between ngi socal and iferc , epng , san juan
award criteria : adjustment ( + / - ) to floating price
block two
volume : 49 , 000 mmbtu / d
term : 1 year , 01 / 01 / 03 thru 12 / 31 / 03
receipt : san juan , ignacio or blanco
delivery : california border - not to exceed 35 , 000 mmbtu / d at needles .
price : floating . difference between ngi socal and iferc , epng , san juan
award criteria : adjustment ( + / - ) to floating price
block three
volume : 11 , 000 mmbtu / d
term : 2 years , 01 / 01 / 02 thru 12 / 31 / 03
receipt : san juan , ignacio or blanco
delivery : east of thoreau
price : floating . difference between ngi socal and iferc , epng , san juan *
award criteria : adjustment ( + / - ) to floating price
* mismatch between delivery point and pricing location is an attempt to
capture more of the spread value . however , early discussions with shippers
indicates the structure may not be marketable . we may ultimately revert to
selling it on a "" san juan to eot "" basis .
transwestern attempted to impose a deadline for consideration of these blocks
on friday , jan . 5 , in order to bring closure . however , some parties were
not able to comply and will be providing proposals on monday .
if an acceptable offer for one or more of these blocks ( blocks one and two ,
in particular ) is received on monday , then in addition to the preparation of
the physical gas transportation contract , a hedging strategy to lock - in the
spread value should be implemented .
i ' ve spoken with dave neubauer and others ( larry , morgan , vernon and theresa )
regarding the execution of an appropriate risk management strategy . in
particular , i spoke with morgan about hedging the basis risk by executing
fixed / floating price swaps at the receipt and delivery ends . we ' ve already
talked with the potential shippers about using ngi socal at the california
border and iferc , epng , san juan for receipts . these indices appear to be
the most liquid with respect to trading the paper . they are also highly
correlated to physical prices at the receipt and delivery locations off
transwestern .
if the physical transport deals are completed on monday , i believe we should
move to execute derivative instruments to hedge the basis spread .
indications from counterparties earlier in the week are showing about a $ 1 . 40
spread in ' 02 and $ 0 . 90 in ' 03 . however , given the current state of the gas
market , and after consulting with steve harris , i also believe we should
leave the price risk open on the fuel collection under these contracts . it
seems imprudent at this point to lock - in fuel gas prices that are at
historically high levels .
i ' ve attempted to at least "" tee - up "" the requisite paperwork that will
document the physical transaction , hedge transaction and attempted hedge
strategy . i ' ve included it below for your use if a hedge is indeed put on
for these pending transactions . please feel free to modify or to make such
changes as you see necessary .
i ' ll be in washington d . c . on monday and tuesday . i ' ll have my cell phone
with me and will be checking messages also . call if you have questions .",ham

in another potentially serious blow to enron corp . ' s finances , moody ' s investors service inc . lowered its ratings by one notch on the energy company ' s senior unsecured debt and kept the company under review for a possible further downgrade .
it also was learned that the securities and exchange commission has moved its inquiry into enron ' s finances to the agency ' s washington headquarters from its regional office in fort worth , texas . the change is a sign that the probe is being treated as a high priority , according to a person with knowledge of the inquiry . an sec spokesman declined to comment .
moody ' s reduction on enron ' s senior unsecured long - term debt to baa 2 from baal leaves the company ' s credit rating two levels above noninvestment grade . if the energy - trading giant ' s ratings were to fall to a noninvestment - grade level , there could be serious consequences for enron . it could throw the houston company into default on obligations involving billions of dollars of borrowings and force it under the terms of various financial agreements to issue millions of shares of stock to holders of that debt , which would dilute the value of existing shares .
while enron still has some room before hitting noninvestment - grade status , there have been concerns among analysts and investors that the company ' s recent troubles could escalate . during recent days enron ' s bonds have traded at levels similar to securities that carry a noninvestment - grade rating . prices of the company ' s bonds improved somewhat yesterday , though its stock price continued to fall sharply . in 4 p . m . new york stock exchange composite trading , enron stock was at $ 13 . 81 , down $ 1 . 59 or 10 % , and topped the most - active list with 36 . 4 million shares changing hands . enron ' s share price has fallen more than 50 % during the past two weeks .
an enron spokeswoman said the company is "" working diligently "" to keep an investment - grade credit rating . among other things , the nation ' s biggest energy - trading firm is in negotiations with its banks on a new $ 1 billion to $ 2 billion credit line to bolster its liquidity . enron repeatedly has said its business operations remain strong .
yesterday ' s ratings downgrade is the latest piece of bad news for a company that has been engulfed in turmoil during the past two weeks . confidence in its financial situation was shaken after enron earlier this month announced a $ 618 million third - quarter loss and disclosed a $ 1 . 2 billion erosion of shareholder equity related to transactions it had carried out with entities connected to its then - chief financial officer , andrew fastow . last week , enron named a successor to mr . fastow and said the sec was looking into the deals .
the sec is looking into whether enron violated federal - securities laws regarding its handling and disclosure of the transactions connected to mr . fastow , the person familiar with the probe said . generally , the sec ' s headquarters office has more resources to apply to complex , high - profile cases than regional offices do . moving the enron inquiry to headquarters indicates that the sec is looking to make a decision relatively quickly about whether or not to allege securities - law violations by the company , this person said .
enron repeatedly has said the transactions were proper and legal . yesterday , the enron spokeswoman said the company is continuing to cooperate with the sec probe and is gathering and sending the agency information that it requested .
moody ' s said the downgrade was "" prompted by the deterioration in enron ' s financial flexibility , "" which has contributed to "" a substantial loss in investor confidence . "" going forward , moody ' s said it will focus on enron management ' s "" success in lining up further liquidity support and on their ability to retain credit availability "" from major trading partners . enron is a principal in nearly one - quarter of all electricity and natural - gas trades in the nation .

enron credit rating is cut , and its share price suffers

shares of the enron corporation fell sharply yesterday after moody ' s investors service lowered the company ' s credit rating , igniting concern that it might have more difficulty raising the cash it needs to finance day - to - day operations .
moody ' s lowered enron ' s senior unsecured long - term debt ratings to baa 2 , two levels above so - called junk status , from baal .
moody ' s also said it might downgrade enron ' s commercial paper rating , which could make it harder for the company , the nation ' s largest energy - trading concern , to borrow the short - term cash it needs to run its trading business in the future . the company borrowed from banks to repay $ 2 billion in commercial paper last week . it is trying to raise $ 1 billion to $ 2 billion in additional financing from banks .
' ' a credit downgrade will be punitive as far as their borrowing power , ' ' said joe correnti , who follows enron for wayne hummer investments in chicago . ' ' that ' s not a good place for them to be . they have somewhat aggressive expansion plans . ' '
shares of enron , which is based in houston , plunged $ 1 . 59 , or 10 . 3 percent , to $ 13 . 81 , continuing the daily trading losses dating to oct . 17 , when enron reported $ 1 . 01 billion in losses from investments outside its business of trading commodities like electricity and natural gas .
the company ' s stock , which is down almost 60 percent in a week , is falling faster than the company ' s debt because the bond holders have first claim on assets after bank loans are paid .
after the moody ' s downgrade , the company ' s 6 . 4 percent bonds maturing in 2006 fell 4 cents , to 80 cents on each $ 1 of face value . yields have risen to 12 . 1 percent , up from 10 . 8 percent before that downgrade , traders said . the bonds were trading at face value the week before .
moody ' s said the cut was prompted by the ' ' deterioration in enron ' s financial flexibility ' ' since the write - downs and charges . investment partnerships involving the company ' s former chief financial officer that had not been disclosed before this month ' ' led to a substantial loss in investor confidence , ' ' moody ' s said .
andrew fastow , the former chief financial officer , resigned , and the securities and exchange commission asked for information about the transactions he conducted for the partnerships he headed .
enron ' s recent woes had many investors factoring in a credit - rating reduction . ' ' this move was anticipated , ' ' said mike dineen , who holds enron bonds in the $ 5 billion of fixed - income assets he helps manage at the mony life insurance company .
enron ' s long - term credit ratings outlook was changed last week to negative from stable by standard & poor ' s . s . & p . affirmed the company ' s rating of bbb + , the equivalent of moody ' s baal .

moody ' s investors service yesterday downgraded the long - term debt ratings of enron , the us energy group , citing "" the deterioration in enron ' s financial flexibility "" over the past two weeks .
moody ' s was the first of the main rating agencies to downgrade the struggling houston - based company ' s debt by lowering it from three to just two notches above "" junk "" status .
moody ' s began reviewing enron for a possible downgrade on october 16 , when the company disclosed a surprising dollars 1 . 2 bn reduction in shareholder equity tied to controversial financing vehicles set up by andrew fastow , then chief financial officer .
mr fastow was replaced last week , as enron ' s share and bond prices plunged on concerns about other possible disclosures . the securities and exchange commission is undertaking an informal inquiry into the group ' s financial dealings .
enron has been forced to seek additional credit from banks after raising dollars 3 . 3 bn in cash last week to boost its financial position .
investors have grown increasingly wary about a company that has long been a wall street favourite . its stock has fallen by more than 50 per cent since october 16 , and its bond prices are trading at levels technically considered "" junk "" status .
"" moody ' s actions are prompted by the deterioration in enron ' s financial flexibility since the company announced significant write - downs as well as equity charges in previously undisclosed partnership investments , "" moody ' s said . "" this led to a substantial loss in investor confidence . ""
even as the us rating agency lowered the company ' s senior unsecured long - term debt ratings from baal to baa 2 , it said they remained on review for downgrade . moody ' s also placed enron ' s prime 2 rating for commercial paper on review . yesterday enron ' s stock closed the day off dollars 1 . 59 - 10 . 32 per cent - at dollars 1 . 81 and its five - year bond was quoted at about 82 cents in the dollar . sell - or - buy poser , page 22 private equity woes , page 30 www . ft . com / enron

global investing : private equity woes sap enron ' s energy
financial times ; oct 30 , 2001
enron has just provided the world with another lesson in the difficulties of public companies investing in private equity .
on october 16 the company ' s management announced a dollars 1 . 01 bn charge and a dollars 1 . 2 bn reduction to shareholders ' equity arising from ljm 2 co - investment and ljm cayman , two structured products designed to protect it against the fluctuation in value of its private equity investments .
andrew fastow , who was last week replaced as the chief financial officer of the houston - based energy trading giant , set up a private equity fund called ljm , designed to fund enron transactions .
ljm deals did not normally appear on enron ' s balance sheet . and that may have been the point of the structure .
a financial engineer explained that enron could have set up a fund , whose changing valuations did not increase the volatility of the trading company ' s earnings , by taking only a minority stake in the ljm fund with some passive co - investors .
the investors would normally receive a debt - like pay - off , except in cases where the value of the private equity holdings fell , when they would get compensation in enron shares .
the value of the portfolio , which included investments in the new power company and some broadband companies , did fall precipitously . by the end of last quarter enron was obliged to issue 62 m shares to the passive investors to compensate them . but instead it ended up taking large cash charges .
was it worth all this trouble for enron to keep its volatile private equity holdings off its balance sheet ? obviously not .
mr fastow has now taken a leave of absence and the securities and exchange commission has launched an informal investigation into whether enron ' s transactions with the ljm companies were really completed at arms ' length . the company ' s market capitalisation has halved and its bonds are trading at distressed levels .
but there could still be a good argument for enron being in private equity . it is almost as much a technology company as it is an energy one and as such it might make sense to outsource some of its research and development to a corporate venture capital unit .
the problem is shareholders ' dim view of private equity . shareholders refused to give chase manhattan bank a growth multiple when venture capital made up a large proportion of its earnings , but punished its successor , jp morgan chase , when it took a succession of private equity write - downs .
jp morgan chase claims a 40 per cent internal rate of return on its investments since inception . but investors have remained stubbornly fixated on private equity ' s short - term valuation swings .
the bank is now in the process of raising outside money for its private equity fund , jp morgan partners , in an effort to take some of its investment off the balance sheet and change the business into a steady revenue producer .
private equity professionals argue that those swings are often meaningless anyway because half way through the life of many private equity investments , their valuations tend to look far worse than they end up .
in enron ' s case it might have been easier for investors to keep their eyes on the long term , if the short - term outlook had been a little clearer . the trading company has faced severe criticism for its lack of disclosure to investors .
ironically , the energy company ' s subtle balance sheet games may in the short term have increased the allure of the company ' s trading businesses , which continue to perform strongly and experience impressive growth . and for that reason it could probably be argued that mr fastow thought he was serving enron ' s interests by managing the partnerships - although he is also reported to have been very well compensated for the service .
long - term the partnerships have clearly undermined enron ' s reputation for plain dealing still further .
the saddest thing for the corporate world is that enron is arguably a more natural private equity investor than jp morgan . as a financial institution , jp morgan is arguably most interested in the short - term synergies private equity creates with its other businesses . high capital charges that bank private equity holdings will soon attract will make them less attractive as long - term investments .
enron was investing in new businesses that it thought would help make its own businesses grow . it was harnessing the immense entrepreneurial power of private equity to make its business grow .
the first reaction of investors and regulators will be to punish enron for its shenanigans . later someone might want to think about changing the mark to market system that drove it to these extraordinary lengths .

shares in enron , the energy trading company , continued their downward spiral yesterday , with investors responding coolly to reports that the houston company was seeking new credit lines .
at midday the stock was down 9 per cent at $ 14 . 10 .
investor anger has been focused on enron executives who still have much to explain about several off - balance - sheet vehicles and potential conflicts of interest for the company ' s former chief financial officer .
wall street analysts are beginning to rethink their overwhelmingly favourable guidance earlier in the year .
"" if i could go back to july and downgrade the stock again , i would certainly do that , "" said curt launer , analyst at credit suisse first boston . "" i can ' t go back . the question is : what are you going to do today ? today , i would like to buy it because of the valuations . ""
mr launer continues to rate enron as a "" strong buy "" and he is not alone . despite weeks of turbulent financial disclosures , the august departure of enron ' s chief executive , jeff skilling , and the more recent departure of cfo andrew fastow , analysts have wavered little in their initial bullishness .
among analysts who issue recommendations on the company , nine are "" strong buys "" , five are "" buys "" and only one is a "" strong sell "" , according to thomson financial / first call .
there is no doubt the recent turmoil at enron has created a new difficulty for analysts . do they hold on and hope for an upturn despite continued questions about the company ' s disclosure quality , or do they recommend that investors unload their holdings for fears that problems could mount ?
they are defending their recommendations based on enron ' s strong track record . net income , on an operating basis , surged 32 per cent last year to $ 1 . 3 bn , on revenues more than doubled to $ 101 bn . during the past 15 years , enron ' s market capitalisation surged from $ 2 bn to a peak of $ 70 bn . even today analysts point to enron ' s strong position in key sectors of power and gas trading .
however , at least one independent research firm decided to tell investors to get out early . off wall street consulting group in cambridge , massachusetts , put enron on its "" sell "" list in early may when the shares traded just below $ 60 .
"" we discussed the partnerships ( former cfo ) fastow was involved in and that there was not much detail there , "" said mark roberts , analyst at ows . "" their accounting is extraordinarily difficult to get through and when people make things that difficult there ' s usually a reason . ""
despite their relative optimism , most analysts say more bad news could follow .
"" the clear immediate task for enron is to make sure it has enough liquidity to help maintain its credit rating , "" said andre meade , head of us utility research at commerzbank securities .
mr meade issued a "" hold "" recommendation early last year , but has since upgraded to "" accumulate "" as the stock became more affordable . "" we ' ve been saying the numbers have been coming in and they have been hitting earnings ( estimates ) , but ( some of its ) businesses are black boxes and you don ' t know how the company is making money from quarter to quarter . ""
yesterday a new note of caution was sounded by carol levenson , fixed - income analyst at gimme credit research group . "" the ensuing total collapse of management credibility and market confidence could have negative credit implications far beyond the potential financial impact disclosed so far , "" she said .

boeing fell 8 . 2 per cent to $ 34 . 59 in response to friday ' s news that the pentagon had awarded the $ 200 bn joint striker fighter contract to rival lockheed martin .
lockheed martin gained 2 . 7 per cent to $ 51 . 28 on the news . the company is expected to hire 2 , 500 more staff over the life of the contract .
analysts were hesitant to pinpoint the jsf contract news as a cause for yesterday morning ' s sell - off .
"" this ( sell - off ) doesn ' t really seem to be event - specific , "" says tom van leuven at jp morganchase . "" we ' ve seen a strong bounce in recent weeks and the news flow doesn ' t support that . . . earnings have been bad and economic data isn ' t likely to be positive . ""
also depressing the dow was united technologies , down 4 . 2 per cent at $ 54 . 60 even though its pratt & whitney engine unit is poised to gain from the jsf contract to lockheed .
shares of echostar retreated fractionally to $ 25 . 03 after the company ' s surprise victory in the battle to acquire hughes electronics , the owner of the biggest us satellite broadcaster , directv and itself a general motors unit . the tracking stock for hughes fell to $ 14 . 68 , while general motors stock retreated to $ 43 . 35 , a 4 . 5 per cent fall in both cases .

fedex , the shipping company , gained 4 . 7 per cent to $ 41 . 36 as it announced that its earnings would beat estimates , even though they would come in below figures for the comparable quarter last year .
in the energy sector , shares of enron were down 8 per cent to $ 14 . 16 after the beleaguered company announced it was seeking additional credit .
toronto fell in early trading , hit by the weak opening for us equities and concern about loan provisions in the banking sector . the s & p 300 composite index was off 0 . 9 per cent at 6 , 942 . 60 at midsession .
bank of montreal fell 5 per cent or c $ 1 . 70 to c $ 33 . 00 following friday ' s announcement of a big rise in loan loss provisions for this year .

moody ' s downgrades enron debt
move likely to hurt its leverage

enron corp . saw its long - term debt rating lowered by one notch monday , sending the stock to seven - year lows and further hampering the company ' s efforts to restore investor and client confidence .
moody ' s investors service downgraded enron ' s rating from baal to baa 2 , where it will remain on review for further downgrade , moody ' s said in a statement . the firm also placed the houston company ' s prime - 2 rating for commercial paper on review for downgrade .
the baa 2 rating is just two notches above what are commonly called "" junk bonds , "" but in line with the ratings of other competing energy companies , simmons & co . international analyst jeff dietert noted .
"" for example , el paso is a baa 2 , mirant is baa 2 , calpine is baa 3 , "" he said . "" it ' s similar to the others in the industry . ""

bad things , it seems , often happen in threes . if that ' s so , wall street could be facing a bout of deja vu .
three financial stories currently unfolding bear a slim resemblance to events that nearly caused gridlock in global financial markets in 1998 . the analogy is strained , but so are nerves in the post - sept . 11 era . case in point : the dow jones industrial average fell more than 275 points monday - - its biggest point loss since the week after markets reopened following the attacks - - despite a lack of dramatically downbeat news .
one of the closely watched sagas on wall street , the deepening problems at energy trading innovator enron , is being compared to the tragically flawed long - term capital management private investment fund .
at long - term capital , professional investors with impressive resumes made a series of disastrous bets , requiring a government - induced bailout in 1998 by major financial institutions that had financed their schemes with massive loans .
on monday , houston - based enron struggled to raise emergency cash as its stock fell another 10 percent , to $ 13 . 81 .
enron shares , which have fallen from above $ 80 at the end of last year , have collapsed more than 50 percent this month as analysts began to question mysterious financial deals between the company and company insiders . last week , enron ' s chief financial officer was replaced .
there was no indication monday that enron ' s troubles have impaired the natural gas and electricity markets . nor has the enron predicament yet sparked a backdraft on its lenders .
the two other strings of the story - - debt problems at a sovereign nation and currency imbalances - - seem relevant only by coincidence .
the implosion at long - term capital occurred amid a surprise default by russia on international debts . separately , currencies of several asian countries ran aground a second year , events that deepened long - term capital ' s woes .
current speculation that argentina will default on $ 132 billion of international debts hardly represents a shock similar to the russian debt default . the problems of argentina ' s economy and financial system , while serious , have been well - known for months .
on monday , argentina hired a merrill lynch consultant , jacob frankel , to craft a financial restructuring and said a workout plan will be disclosed in a few days .
meanwhile , monday ' s slide in the value of the dollar in foreign currency markets reversed the dollar ' s surprising strength in the wake of the attacks .
indeed , the relative stability of the dollar has been a major contributor to investor confidence . the current slippage by the dollar hardly indicates extraordinary instability .
as far as we know , enron was not engaged in currency speculation or deals pegged to argentina . but enron shareholders and the securities and exchange commission have just begun to investigate .
monday ' s action : stocks closed broadly lower in light trading monday , as investors awaited several key economic reports due out this week , including friday ' s scheduled report on job losses and the unemployment rate in october .
treasury securities rallied on expectations that the economic downturn will be more pronounced and longer than many investors believe and will prompt the federal reserve to cut interest rates through the end of the year .
the dow jones industrial average fell 275 . 67 points , or 2 . 9 percent , to 9269 . 50 . chicago - based boeing , which lost a major defense contract to rival lockheed martin , led the dow losers . boeing lost $ 3 . 93 , or 10 . 4 percent , to $ 33 . 75 .
only one of the 30 dow industrials , sbc communications , posted a gain .
the broader standard & poor ' s 500 index dropped 26 . 31 , or 2 . 4 percent , to 1078 . 30 . new york stock exchange trading volume reached 1 . 11 billion shares , as losing stocks outnumbered winners by 2 - 1 .
the nasdaq composite index fell 69 . 44 , or 3 . 9 percent , to 1699 . 52 . nasdaq trading volume totaled 1 . 67 billion shares . losers topped winners by nearly 2 - 1 among nasdaq stocks .
computer networking giant cisco systems led the nasdaq most - active list , dropping 87 cents , to $ 16 . 42 . a . g . edwards revoked its "" strong buy "" rating on the stock .
the russell 2000 index of small - company stocks lost 9 . 24 , or 2 . 1 percent , to 429 . 41 .
fund flows : mutual fund investors withdrew a net $ 29 . 5 billion from equity funds in september , the biggest one - month dollar amount for net redemptions , according to the investment company institute , the trade association for mutual funds .
the redemptions equaled less than 1 percent of assets in stock funds , compared with more than 3 percent withdrawn in october 1987 , reflecting the stock market crash of that month . by contrast , cash flow last month into money - market funds soared by $ 53 billion .
treasury auction : interest rates fell again at the treasury ' s weekly auction of 3 - month and 6 - month bills .
the discount rate for 3 - month bills was 2 . 05 percent , the lowest rate since august 1958 . the rate for 6 - month bills was 2 . 00 percent , the lowest rate on record .
the coupon - equivalent investment rates at monday ' s auction were 2 . 09 percent for 3 - month bills and 2 . 05 percent for 6 - month bills . bill barnhart

enron corp . ' s shares fell near a seven - year low monday , as the limping energy giant said it was lobbying banks for a new credit line and a rating agency chopped enron ' s senior unsecured debt to two notches above junk status .
the nation ' s largest natural gas and power marketing company is struggling to bounce back from disappointing third - quarter earnings and a scandal over losses stemming from partnerships managed by the company ' s former chief financial officer .
enron shares fell more than 10 percent , or $ 1 . 59 a share , to close at $ 13 . 81 on the new york stock exchange . a year ago , enron stock sold at nearly $ 85 a share .
the ratings cut by moody ' s investors service , which warned it could slash that rate again and also enron ' s short - term debt status , was the latest sword thrust into what was once the raging bull of the energy trading arena .
meanwhile , enron on monday confirmed it was seeking additional credit lines after tapping its $ 3 . 3 billion lines last week , but declined to say how much it was asking its banks to extend .
"" we want to restore investor confidence and nothing instills confidence like cash , "" enron spokesman mark palmer said . that should leave enron with a net cash position of $ 1 . 2 billion , moody ' s said .

enron corp . shares declined monday for a ninth day as moody ' s investors service lowered its credit rating , creating concern that the largest energy trader will be cut off from raising the cash it needs to fund day - to - day operations .
moody ' s lowered enron ' s senior unsecured long - term debt ratings to baa 2 , two levels above junk , from baal and also placed the houston - based company ' s p - 2 rating for commercial paper on review for downgrade .
moody ' s said it may downgrade enron ' s commercial paper rating , which would make it harder for the firm to borrow the short - term cash needed to run its trading businesses . ahead of a potential cut , enron took out bank lines to repay $ 2 billion in commercial paper last week .
"" they ' ve pretty much already written off coming to the commercial paper market , "" said shannon bass , who holds enron bonds in the $ 50 million he helps manage at pacific investment management co . "" the real issue now is trying to get their house in order . ""
enron shares plunged $ 1 . 59 , or 10 % , to close at a seven - year low of $ 13 . 81 on the new york stock exchange , continuing a slide that dates back to oct . 17 , the day after enron reported $ 1 . 01 billion in losses from investments outside its energy trading business . the stock has fallen about 60 % since oct . 17 .
enron has lost more than $ 50 billion in market value this year . on dec . 31 , enron had a market value of $ 62 . 7 billion . on monday , the value was $ 10 . 5 billion .
moody ' s said the rating cut was prompted by the "" deterioration in enron ' s financial flexibility "" since the write - downs and charges . the partnership investments had not previously been disclosed , leading "" to a substantial loss in investor confidence . ""
last week , enron ousted finance chief andrew fastow after the securities and exchange commission asked about transactions he conducted for partnerships he headed .

a wall street journal online news roundup
houston - - enron corp . ' s stock slid further monday , pushed down in part by moody ' s investors service announcing a downgrade of the company ' s credit rating .
the downgrade came as enron negotiates with banks to establish new credit lines as the nation ' s largest natural gas and power marketing company struggles to bounce back from disappointing third - quarter earnings and a scandal over losses stemming from partnerships managed by the company ' s former chief financial officer .
in composite trading monday at 4 p . m . on the new york stock exchange , enron ( ene ) shares were down $ 1 . 59 , or 10 . 32 % , at $ 13 . 81 . a year ago , enron stock traded at nearly $ 85 a share .
enron ' s efforts to acquire more credit came after the company last week decided to cash in about $ 3 billion in revolving credit it has with various banks to shore up investor confidence .
"" we are in discussions about new credit lines , "" enron spokeswoman karen denne said monday . "" we ' re taking action to restore investor and market confidence . ""
ms . denne wouldn ' t disclose how much credit the company was seeking . the wall street journal reported in its monday editions that the amount is between $ 1 billion and $ 2 billion and that the deal is close to being completed .
ms . denne said of the $ 3 billion in credit enron cashed in last week , $ 2 billion of it was used to pay short term debt . currently , there are no plans for the other $ 1 billion , she said .
moody ' s on monday lowered enron ' s senior unsecured long - term debt ratings from baal to baa 2 where they remain on review for downgrade . moody ' s additionally placed the company ' s prime - 2 rating for commercial paper on review for downgrade , citing "" substantially reduced valuations in several of its businesses . ""
houston - based enron is the nation ' s biggest energy trader and a principal in nearly one - quarter of all electricity and natural - gas trades . once a favorite of wall street , the company now is in the unfamiliar position of convincing a deeply concerned investment community that , despite difficulties , its finances remain sound .
confidence in enron ' s situation was shaken after enron earlier this month announced a $ 618 million third - quarter loss and disclosed a $ 1 . 2 billion erosion of shareholder equity related to controversial transactions it had done with entities connected to its then - chief financial officer , andrew fastow .
moody ' s said in a press release the "" magnitude of the announced charges will reduce enron ' s equity base and increase nominal financial leverage to somewhat over 50 % while slashing earnings . ""
enron ' s debt is still investment grade at both moody ' s and standard & poor ' s and would have to be lowered by several notches to fall into a noninvestment - grade category .

power suppliers urge changes in u . s . price - cap rules for west
2001 - 10 - 29 19 : 00 ( new york )
power suppliers urge changes in u . s . price - cap rules for west
washington , oct . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - companies that sell power
in the western u . s . said the region may face blackouts this winter
unless federal regulators permit them to charge more for
electricity than current price limits allow .
dynegy inc . , enron corp . and other power suppliers said they
may not have electricity to offer during regional shortages this
winter if the price caps that the federal energy regulatory
commission set for california and 10 western states in april and
june aren ' t eliminated or changed . they said the present limit may
be too low to encourage dam owners to generate electricity .
` ` the price mitigation plan , the way it is now , will make it
difficult to induce supply , ' ' g . alan comnes , director of
government affairs for enron power marketing , told the commission
at a conference in washington .
the commission is considering changes to the pricing formula
it set after skyrocketing electricity costs led to insolvency for
california ' s largest utilities , units of pg & e corp . and edison
international . commissioners have said they want to fine - tune the
formula before winter , the peak period of demand in the northwest .
the current pricing formula is based on the most - expensive
power generated in california . power suppliers and utilities in
the pacific northwest , which want to make sure they have enough
power for customers , want the limits to reflect costs from all
generators in the region .
representatives for the california public utilities
commission and edison international ' s southern california edison
said the price limits work and should be continued . california
puc ' s bill julian said the mitigation plan , due to expire sept .
30 , 2002 , should be extended until california ' s utilities are
rehabilitated .
prices lower
the cost of wholesale power in california has dropped since
ferc ordered the first emergency cap on april 25 . the average
price for a megawatt - hour at the california - oregon border in
september was $ 24 . 91 , down from $ 313 . 70 in april . a megawatt - hour
is enough electricity to power about 750 average california homes
for an hour .
one adjustment under consideration would link the pricing
formula to the cost of natural gas , a fuel used to generate about
25 percent of power in the western u . s . , more during low -
hydropower years .
the caps were extended to other western states - - oregon ,
washington , arizona , nevada , wyoming , new mexico , colorado ,
montana , idaho and utah - - in june because some said generators in
the west could simply get around the cap by selling outside
california when prices were higher elsewhere .

ferc warns that power - price controls risk shortages in northwest
by bryan lee
10 / 29 / 2001
dow jones business news
( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . )
dow jones newswires
washington - - the pacific northwest could see power shortages this winter if federal price controls on western power markets aren ' t modified or dropped , electricity industry officials warned federal regulators monday .
the controls , first structured to protect california from another punishing summer , are inappropriate to the northwest , where demand is highest in the winter , the officials said .
"" the western interconnection is an interdependent market , but that does not mean that there is or should be a single price across the market , "" said richard tabors , a consultant to power suppliers and a lecturer at massachusetts institute of technology . "" setting prices in the winter - peaking northwest based on prices set in summer - peaking california and the southwest makes little sense . ""
the caution came at a federal energy regulatory commission technical conference designed to help the agency frame possible changes to a june price - control order capping prices in california and 10 other western states .
the controls work by establishing a proxy for a fair maximum market price for the entire region based on the most expensive generator called into service during power emergencies in california . the proxy - price formula takes into account the cost of natural gas fuel , emissions - control credits and the efficiency of power plants .
but california , which experiences peak demand for electricity in the summer , is unlikely to run into a supply crunch again until next year . that means the price cap set in june will remain in effect throughout the winter , when the pacific northwest experiences its peak - demand period and may need the flexibility to pay higher prices to attract needed power .
if the current price - control regime is maintained , it will discourage sales from the southwest to the northwest this winter , because transmission costs will drive the cost of those sales above ferc ' s price cap , mr . tabors said .
california wants caps to stay
officials representing california and its financially beleaguered utilities urged the commission to maintain the price - control order and to extend it beyond its october 2002 expiration date to prevent a recurrence of last year ' s power - market meltdown .
the price - control regime should remain in place at least until california ' s utilities return to the market as creditworthy buyers , said fong wan of pg & e corp . ( pcg ) and bill julian of the california public utilities commission .
a 10 % markup allowed to compensate for credit risks for sales into california should be dropped , because the california department of water resources , a creditworthy buyer , is purchasing electricity on behalf of the utilities , they said .
ferc ' s price - mitigation order "" has been very successful , "" said gary stern of edison international ( eix ) unit southern california edison co .
prices stabilized shortly after the controls took effect and have been capped at $ 92 per megawatt - hour since late june , the last time the california independent system operator , the state ' s grid manager , called an alert . conservation , mild weather and california ' s entry into billions of dollars in long - term power contracts have kept market prices well below that cap for the most part .
ferc , however , is considering changing the pricing order to reflect the different needs of western utilities outside california . the commission is mulling whether power prices should change at times other than when california declares an emergency , perhaps to reflect fluctuations in natural gas prices .
ferc also is pondering changes to the requirement that generators make all uncommitted power available to california at all times . ferc staff asked whether the so - called must - sell requirement should apply only during emergencies and whether the mandate should be balanced by a "" must - pay "" requirement .
generators have complained that the state still hasn ' t paid for hundreds of millions of dollars worth of power delivered since the department of water resources took over the job of purchasing power for customers of california ' s largest utilities .
california focus challenged
absent withdrawal of ferc ' s price - mitigation order , mr . tabors and other conference participants argued for changes in the order to better account for the predominance of hydropower generation in the northwest .
setting prices throughout the west based on prices in california , which gets most of its power from natural gas - fired generating plants , runs the risk of supply shortages in the northwest this winter , they said .
utilities operating hydropower facilities won ' t know how much generating capacity they ' ll have for next year until february , when a reliable assessment of snowpack will be available . given the uncertainty , hydropower operators will be reluctant to release water for generation this winter .
"" shortages can happen this winter , "" said mike naeve , an attorney with skadden arps meaghre & flom representing portland general electric co . , a unit of enron corp . ( ene ) . "" prices based on natural gas may not be sufficient to release hydro you may need next year . ""
under the current regime , the california independent system operator , controlled by appointees of gov . gray davis , could "" manipulate the market by controlling exports to the northwest , "" said alan comnes of enron power marketing inc . ( ene ) . "" the current price mitigation is sowing the seeds for another crisis . ""
ferc ' s pricing order has already been costly , said mark tallman of scottish power ' s pacificorp ( spi ) . if there is an arctic cold snap in the region this winter , price caps set by the california iso may be insufficient to assure enough supply , he said .
ferc should allow prices to rise to $ 250 per megawatt - hour price cap in the northwest if capacity margins drop to emergency levels , mr . tallman said .
mr . tabors and the enron officials recommended ferc adopt a $ 1 , 000 per megawatt - hour "" circuit breaker "" cap , such as exists in iso - administered markets in texas and the northeast .
ferc ' s pricing order also was criticized for failing to account for the economics of "" peaker "" generating units , which only run during periods of peak demand , when prices typically spike .

subject : extreme value theory applied to weather
dear vince ,
back in july , when you visited our sydney office you mentioned extreme value
theory . i am wondering whether research is looking into the application
of extreme value theory to power and esp . to weather . in a recent news
article it was highlighted that a trend in the industry towards t _ max , t _ min ,
etc .
i am in particular referring to the news article below :
in the past we have observed a similar trend where customers are asking for
t _ max , t _ min , or below or above precipitation structures . the choice in the
past has been the burn analysis on historical data . however , we are in
particular interested in the extreme events , and the application of evt could
provide a meaningful tool for the analysis .
has the research group looked into the application of evt to weather ? evt has
a long history of application in hydrology ( which would cover parts
of the precipitation structures . . . ) . also , research ( esp . at eth in zuerich )
is indicating the application of evt to v @ r . . . .
thank you !

( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
new york , nov 5 ( reuters ) - fitch on monday cut its ratings on the debt of embattled energy trader enron corp . and warned that it may cut the ratings again if the company does not reduce its debts , if its trading business deteriorates or if charges exceed present estimates .
"" today ' s rating action reflects the difficulties enron faces in managing its liquidity position in the face of an erosion in investor confidence , "" fitch said .
fitch cut houston - based enron ' s senior unsecured debt to "" bbb - minus , "" one notch above junk , from "" bbb - plus , "" its subordinated debt to "" bb "" from "" bbb , "" and its commercial paper to "" f 3 "" from "" f 2 . "" the rating agency also downgraded enron ' s preferred stock to "" b - plus "" from "" bbb - minus . ""
fitch said reducing debt and exiting problem businesses are a management priority , and if enron is successful , the company ' s credit profile will improve . "" however , the targeted transactions have varying degrees of execution risk , particularly the divestiture of assets in emerging - market countries , "" fitch said .
fitch ' s cut follows downgrades last week by moody ' s investors service and standard & poor ' s . enron ' s shares have lost more than 65 percent in less than a month amid concerns about financial practices that triggered an investigation by the u . s . securities and exchange commission .
s & p last thursday cut enron ' s corporate credit and senior unsecured debt ratings to "" bbb , "" two notches above junk status , from "" bbb - plus . "" moody ' s investors service last monday cut enron ' s senior unsecured debt to "" baa 2 , "" two notches above junk , from "" baal . ""
downgrades could make it tougher for enron to issue debt and run its day - to - day business if fellow marketers and traders demand more collateral .
enron lined up $ 1 billion of new credit last week but may still have to sell assets to head off a credit squeeze and restore investor confidence , according to investment bankers .
in its third - quarter results report last month , enron said it expected over a billion dollars of write - offs related to soured investments . it also announced an extra $ 1 . 2 billion write - down of shareholder equity related to investments that were not recorded on its balance sheet .
enron ' s 6 . 4 percent notes due in 2006 , bid at about 80 cents on the dollar a week ago , were bid at 73 cents on the dollar on monday , a strategist said .
enron shares were up 40 cents , or 3 . 55 percent , at $ 11 . 67 in midday trade on the new york stock exchange . the shares have been in free - fall for two weeks .

business wire
( copyright ( c ) 2001 , business wire )
new york - - ( business wire ) - - nov . 5 , 2001 - - fitch downgrades enron ' s outstanding securities as follows : senior unsecured debt to ` bbb - ' from ` bbb + ' ; subordinated debt to ` bb ` from ` bbb ' ; and preferred stock to ` b + ' from ` bbb - ` . enron ' s commercial paper has been downgraded to ` f 3 ' from ` f 2 ' . the senior unsecured debt ratings of its pipeline subsidiaries , northern natural gas co . and transwestern pipeline co . , are lowered to ` bbb - ' from ` a - ` . all the above securities remain on rating watch negative status . fitch would consider further downgrades if enron were unable to make progress in reducing debt , if its wholesale marketing and trading business were to show signs of material deterioration , or if expenses and charges related to the disposition of non - core businesses and investments exceed present estimations .
today ' s rating action reflects the difficulties enron faces in managing its liquidity position in the face of an erosion in investor confidence . this follows the recognition of a substantial diminution in value of its global merchant investments , which were partly financed with an aggressive use of off - balance sheet vehicles . enron should be able to manage through this challenging environment , ultimately recognizing the values of the company ' s core businesses .
in october , enron fully drew down the bulk of its committed bank facilities and paid down outstanding commercial paper , leaving it approximately $ 1 billion of cash on hand to support normal business activities . in addition , the company is in the process of executing a new $ 1 billion secured bank facility that pledges the assets of northern natural and transwestern . unsecured creditors are structurally subordinated to the secured lenders reducing asset coverage . while its current cash position appears adequate , securing additional capital sources through asset sales or raising additional capital would be a favorable development .
a management priority is debt reduction and the exiting of problem businesses . clearly , these actions , if completed as envisioned will reduce risk and improve the company ' s credit profile . however , the targeted transactions have varying degrees of execution risk , particularly the divestiture of assets in emerging market countries . an additional uncertainty is the securities and exchange commission ' s ( sec ) investigation of certain enron sponsored partnerships . the outcome and potential impact of the sec activity is difficult to predict .
the largest announced transaction is the sale of portland general electric co . ( pge ) to northwest natural gas co . the sale appears to be moving ahead as planned and has the favorable support of key local interests . however , the transaction is not expected to close for another year .
enron ' s core businesses have continued to generate strong , predictable performance and have significant value . prospectively , operations at enron ' s domestic regulated pipelines would be less affected by any lingering uncertainty at enron . also , pge is expected to generate positive and predictable earnings and cash flow over the next year . combined , the pipelines and pge generate nearly 25 % of ebitda . wholesale and retail energy services segments have also consistently reported predictable and growing returns . specifically , commodity marketing and trading activities , which comprise the most profitable and largest part of wholesale operations , have generated steady volume growth and stable unit margins . however , if enron were unable to maintain the support of its counterparties or exhibited diminished financial flexibility , these businesses would be harmed .

( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
new york , nov 5 ( reuters ) - stocks are seen climbing at the open of trading on monday , as wall street looks for another half - point interest - rate cut on tuesday to help put the lagging economy back on track and boost slumping corporate profits .
equities are getting an additional boost from the treasury ' s decision last week to stop selling 30 - year bonds , sending cash flowing out of bonds and into stocks , traders said .
the gain in futures is "" the half - point talking , "" said brian finnerty , co - head of capital markets at c . e . unterberg towbin . "" the cut continues the aggressive moves on the part of the fed , and it comes on top of a huge move by the treasury . the treasury did more in one fell swoop last week than the fed ' s done all year . ""
technology stocks rose in early trading , as investors geared up for cisco systems inc . ' s quarterly results after exchanges close . analysts said the networking gear maker is likely to signal lagging sales are near a turnaround .
december futures for the standard & poor ' s 500 index climbed 8 points , or 0 . 7 percent , to 1 , 097 . 50 , while december futures for the nasdaq composite index rose 21 points , or 1 . 5 percent , to 1 , 454 . 50 . the indicative dow jones index , which represents a basket of dow stocks trading in europe , slipped 2 . 4 points , or 0 . 02 percent .
the u . s . federal reserve is widely expected to cut interest rates for a 10 th time this year at its meeting on tuesday , to help jump - start the lagging economy . lower interest rates cut borrowing costs and can spur business development .
blue chips rallied on friday , helping the broader market eke out gains , as investors shrugged off a report of the biggest u . s . job losses in more than two decades in october to bet on an economic recovery next year .
"" any kind of bad news hasn ' t been able to hold the market down , "" said bob basel , a listed trader with salomon smith barney .
cisco rose to $ 17 . 80 on electronic trading system instinet , up from its close of $ 17 . 26 . the company , which makes networking gear that helps power the internet , is expected to report fiscal first - quarter results after exchanges close . cisco is likely to signal sales are near a rebound , indicating the lagging tech industry has reached its low point and will begin to rebound soon , analysts and investors said .
microsoft corp . rose to $ 61 . 74 from its friday close of $ 61 . 40 . microsoft and the justice department reached a settlement agreement last week . still , state antitrust enforcers have found what they say are serious flaws in the settlement , and the two sides may not be able to sign the deal in its current form , the wall street journal reported in its online edition on monday . the european union said on monday its probe of microsoft continues despite the settlement .
enron corp . , the struggling energy giant , rose to $ 11 . 80 on instinet , up from its close of $ 11 . 27 on friday . royal dutch / shell group may mount an $ 11 billion bid for enron , the uk ' s independent paper reported on sunday .
enron lined up $ 1 billion of new credit last week , but it still suffered a second credit rating cut amid concerns about questionable financial transactions that have triggered an investigation by the u . s . securities and exchange commission .
pixar animation studios inc . jumped to $ 37 . 25 from a friday close of $ 36 . 70 . pixar and walt disney co . scored a monstrous opening with their latest family cartoon "" monsters , inc . , "" scaring up $ 63 . 5 million in ticket sales in its first three days , according to studio estimates issued on sunday .
baxter international inc . fell to $ 47 . 60 on instinet from its close of $ 49 after it said preliminary tests show a processing fluid used in its manufacturing operations in sweden may have played a role in kidney patient deaths linked to dialysis machines .
baxter said it plans to permanently discontinue making the product and warned it will take a fourth - quarter charge to cover costs related to the product cancellation .
european markets gained on monday , led by technology and auto stocks . solid wall street futures and the prospect of more interest rate cuts later this week buoyed sentiment , traders said . wall street ' s resiliency on friday , when investors looked beyond poor payrolls numbers and bet on a recovery next year , also helped steady european nerves .
the ftse eurotop 300 index was up 1 . 5 percent and the euro stoxx 50 index rose 1 . 8 percent . technology and auto stocks were the strongest as players funneled cash back into sectors which fell hard after the sept . 11 attacks in the united states .
tokyo stocks inched higher in extremely thin trade on monday after gains in sony corp and other select blue - chip stocks buoyed a market still wary of dwindling earnings and a bleak outlook for the u . s . economy .
the benchmark nikkei average climbed 0 . 61 percent or 63 . 76 points to 10 , 447 . 54 , landing in positive turf for the second straight session .

reuters english news service
( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
london , nov 5 ( reuters ) - british electricity trading was slow on monday , with traders saying prompt prices were ending broadly unchanged after a higher start in part because of a band of colder weather affecting much of the country .
"" it ' s a fairly quiet market , still lacking liquidity , "" said one trader , referring to the reluctance of some companies to deal with enron .
in the u . s . the securities and exchange commision is investigating substantial losses at enron relating to a private equity operation run by the group ' s former chief financial officer .
traders said the prompt market opened strong with day - ahead baseload lifted at 20 pounds a megawatt hour .
but the early strength evaporated during the day and in late trade the contract was down to about 17 pounds .
december baseload gained early support from day - ahead . it was finishing the day at about 18 . 40 pounds from a low of 18 . 34 pounds .
ql 01 baseload was seen as high as 19 . 45 pounds before it fell to 19 . 30 / 19 . 35 pounds in the afternoon .
summer 02 baseload was a touch stronger at 17 . 25 pounds while winter 02 was assessed at 19 . 25 pounds .

we have noticed that we are taking earnings on megs this year which is probably the wrong thing to do based on the fact that we know that future income is negative we should be using the income to write down the holding or against future income .
can you reanalyse the bookings this year and ensure we do not book any earnings .

"the oi | and gas advisory
now that oil and gas has entered a | ong - term bul | market ,
our speciaity in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
undervalued energy plays has produced soaring returns .
emerson oi | and gas ( eogi ) is an energy developer in the us "" oil belt ""
and in canada ' s most highiy coveted reservoirs with generating
potentia | of mi | | ions per week .
breaking news ! ! !
emerson oil and gas identifies lease opportunity in south texas
providing opportunity
for 22 - weil re - entry in field with strong producing history and large
recoverabie reserves
south texas in a large existing fieid that was discovered and dri | | ed
by major oil companies
in the 1970 s . the field is established with substantia | recoverable
reserves , estimated at over
3 . 9 miliion barreis of oi | and about 2 biilion cubic ft . of gas in the
two pay zones .
symbol - eogi
price - . 065
the vaiue of eogi ' s shares wil | skyrocket :
1 . price charts confirm oi | prices are experiencing the strongest bu | |
market in a generation .
2 . natura | gas prices have tripled in the | ast two years .
3 . with muitipie projects in high - gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth multi - millions , eogi is se | | ing for | ess than 1 / 4 the
value of its assets .
4 . emerson oil and gas specializes in using new technology to turn
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitable enterprises .
aiready shares in the oi | and gas sector are rising faster than the
overal | market . in fact , four of dow jones ' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy reiated . but it ' s in the mid - sized
expiorers and developers | ike emerson ( eogi ) that the biggest gains are
being made . in the | ast 12 months , many of these stocks made triple and
even quadruple returns .
our subscribers need to pay particuiariy close attention to undervalued
eogi shares , because it won ' t be a bargain for long . this sma | | company
with a comparabiy sma | | market vaiue , is sitting on a bonanza of oil
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especialiy with
the daily jump in energy prices .
but ail that will change in a few short weeks , as these reserves move
into production , bringing an explosion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market , and have an equa | | y expiosive
effect on the share price .
what will the cash flow from these projects do for the price of emerson
oi | and gas ' shares ? well we do know this - the great thing about
investing in eogi is that your gains don ' t depend on further increases
in the price of oi | and gas . even if energy prices stay flat , or
decline
slightiy , you will stiil make a very heaithy return . of course , energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or so as predicted , meaning the vaiue of eogi ' s assets and earnings
wi | |
soar even higher . in that case , the reward for investors wil | be
staggering .
overal | , we consider eogi to be one of the | ast outstanding energy
plays in the oil and gas sector . once this discovery has been reaiized ,
eogi shares wiil surge sharply on heavy investor attention . we have
identified this discovery for immediate accumulation . eogi ' s oil and
gas reserves are we | | established and are going into massive
production .
eariy investors wiil secure optimum gains , and any additiona | news in
this
area wiil realiy turn up the heat , causing us to revise our targets
upward in next week ' s bu | | etin .

title : extending eu gas guidelines to central and eastern europe
url : http : / / www 20 . cera . com / eprofile ? u = 35 & m = 2184
overview : a comprehensive reform of gas legislation in central and eastern
europe is bringing the region in line with the european union  , s gas
directive . this is true both for the countries expected to enter the union by
2004  ) 05  * czech republic , estonia , hungary , poland , and slovenia - - and for
candidates whose entry is not scheduled before the end of the
decade - - bulgaria , latvia , lithuania , romania , and slovakia . in cera  , s view
current developments regarding the establishment of a legal framework for the
internal gas market in eastern and central europe look promising from an
investor  , s point of view .
the candidate countries presented a review of progress made in the
implementation of the eu gas directive during a two - day workshop held by the
european commission and the world bank in paris in november .
many of these countries have been reforming their energy industries
throughout the 1990 s as part of their transition to a market economy . the
results have been mixed , particularly in the utility industries . the 1998 gas
directive ( adopted in august 2000 ) now offers a compelling incentive for eu
candidate countries to transform their gas industries , while providing a road
map to guide them .
the critical points relevant to harmonization between the european union and
candidate countries include the following :
* legal framework and regulation . the legal framework is the cornerstone of
enlargement and the yardstick of harmonization in europe . as a result , in all
candidate countries in 1999  ) 2000 energy laws were either updated or newly
established along the principles spelled out in the gas directive . regulatory
bodies have been created by law and are operating in every country , although
issues of staffing , financial autonomy , and independence from political
influence are not uniformly resolved .
* third - party access ( tpa ) and long - term take - or - pay contracts . all candidate
countries agree that tpa is a key to market competition . therefore , all have
adopted it or intend to do so in their new legislation . although the
commission favors regulated tpa , the specific approaches to tpa enforcement
in the candidate countries remain unclear in some cases . in particular , the
implementation of tpa will have to address the issue of long - term take - or - pay
contracts with russia that were signed by all major domestic gas companies
and somewhat preempt competition . russian gas is for the most part sold to
single , traditional state - owned operators that dominate their internal
markets . a balance will need to be struck between these incumbent dominant
players and the competitive environment . this is made more complicated by
their ownership of large volumes of russian gas supplied in kind in exchange
for transit rights to west european customers . article 25 of the directive
provides for !
a derogation to companies experiencing difficulties stemming from take - or - pay
obligations . this derogation would apply to the companies of candidate
countries with historical and commercial links with the russian gas industry .
furthermore , article 26 allows derogations to those member states with only
one major gas supplier , to those with an  +  + emerging gas market
status ,  ,  , or to those without a direct gas connection to the grid of another
member state . most of the candidate countries would in principle be able to
call on one or more of these grounds for derogation when they join the
european union .
* price cross - subsidies . residential gas tariffs are artificially low and are
financed partially through higher rates applied to industrial consumers . in
various countries , tariff increases and the phasing out of subsidies have
been scheduled , but such decisions remain politically sensitive to enforce .
this has recently been emphasized by high gas prices owing to the linkage of
imported gas to oil prices . all candidate countries have set legal frameworks
that include the phasing out of cross - subsidies as part of sector reform , but
the actual implementation will remain politically difficult . as table 1
indicates , price rebalancing is already under way in most countries expected
to enter the european union by mid - decade , but the legal framework itself
cannot guarantee the pace of reform . the same goes for candidate countries
that have only recently introduced eu - complying energy laws and whose entry
to the european union is likely to happen in a longer time frame .
* unbundling . most countries understand that the unbundling of transmission
companies from their supply businesses is the second critical element of
liberalization . to date , unbundling the accounts of these two businesses is
all that has been adopted by the member states or in the candidate countries .
in the future , the commission is likely to press all eu countries for legal
separation (  & structural unbundling  8 ) of the businesses , and candidate
countries will have to pursue their reform of the gas sector accordingly .
table 1 gives an overview of the state of play in candidate countries . as the
table shows , the countries belonging to the second group have only very
recently undertaken the reform of the gas sector in accordance with the
directive , whereas change had been introduced earlier in the countries
scheduled for the first wave .

the california puc
loretta lynch held a press conference in sacramento today to discuss changes to the commission ' s previously released proposal regarding direct access and the rate agreement between the puc and dwr .
in the amended proposal discussed and distributed today , direct access would end retroactive to july 1 . customers with contracts executed as of july 1 would would remain direct access customers .
the legislature
the assembly version of the senate mou ( sb 78 ) has not yet been reviewed and voted on in the committee .
it is scheduled to be reviewed and voted on at 6 : 30 pm pdt today .
amendments on direct access were released this afternoon ( based on negotiations between davis ' office and business customers ) :
customers who have consistently been da since may 2000 , including those "" involuntarily "" returned to bundled service , would be exempt from charges for edison ' s undercollection , dwr ' s forward contracts , and dwr - related exit fees , provided that the puc finds that no additional stranded costs are created for edison ' s remaining customers .
customers who have consistently been on da between may 2000 and jan 17 , 2001 would be exempt from charges for edison ' s undercollection , dwr ' s forward contracts and dwr - realted exit fees , provided that the puc finds that no additional stranded costs are created for edison ' s remaining customers .
customers who have been on da between jan 17 , 2001 and august 24 , 2001 would be exempt from exit fees related to dwr forward contracts , provided that the puc finds that no additional stranded costs are created for edison ' s remaining customers .
customer ' s leaving after august 24 th would not qualify for exemptions .
there is considerable work underway to make the august 24 th date the deadline for contract execution , rather than the date by which the customer must be dasr ' d , in order to qualify for the exemptions .
direct access would not be suspended , however , until 90 days after the bill is signed by davis ( if he signs it ) , i . e . , the "" effective date "" of the bill .
so anyone going to direct access between aug 24 and the effective date would not qualify for any exemptions .
after the 90 - day period , da would be suspended until 1 . 1 . 03 .
self - gen in service consistently from may 200 to august 24 would be exempt from edison ' s undercollection and dwr charges .
self - gen that submitted an application to the energy commission by august 24 would be exempt from dwr charges beginning the date that the self - gen comes on line .
self - gen that comes on line after august 24 would be exempt from dwr charges beginning the date that the self - gen comes on line , but the total number of exempt mws in this category would be limited to 250 mws per year , on a first - come - first - serve basis .
at least 30 % of any increases in net short due to increases in demand would be reserved for self gen .",ham

"vince - thanks for the update . what i am not sure of is what if any decision
has to be
made on may 19 . it seems to me that the mystic lady and elba island deals
have already
been approved and executed - but it is quite likely i am missing a detail or
two .

subject : re : lng may 19 decision
john ,
this is the update on what i have done for the lng transactions .
1 . i was not involved in the lng ship project . i shall read the dash
and give you my comments . without looking at the details , i think that the
decision
to charter a tanker removes one significant risk we have at the elba island
project ( please , see point 2 ) .
2 . elba island . i am working with doug rotenberbg , brad hitch , scott earnest
( sally beck ' s organization ) and rac to set up the book for the elba island
transaction . the next step
will be to expand the book to capture all the enron ' s lng - related positions
in one place and
to look for natural risk offsets and possible hedges . a working group is
meeting to close a few
remaining gaps tomorrow ( tuesday ) at 8 : 30 .
a few comments on the book design and my view of the project :
a . the current thinking is that lng will be sourced for the elba island
facility
by buying marginal cargos on the fob basis . marginal cargos will represent
supply from excess capacity that has not been committed under long - term
contracts or became available due to some short - term frictions .
the fob cargos are typically selling at a significant discount to the
long - term
contract prices . the economics of the deal , as represented by the book we are
setting up , will reflect the assumption that not only we can locate marginal
cargos
but that we shall be able to do it on a regular basis , arranging shipping and
coordinating
the facility schedule and natural gas transactions in the us . in other words ,
we have a significant logistical and operational risk in this transaction .
b . the transaction will cover the period of 17 years ( with an extension
option of
5 years ) . even if we can lock - in the lng volumes over this time period , we
have no ability to lock - in the other side of the spread ( us gas prices ) for
such a long tenor . this is
essentially a tolling transaction with exposure to the lng - nat gas spread
and
i would not recommend locking - in only one leg of the spread .
one solution would be to cover , let ' s say , 50 % of he lng volumes for the
first
5 years and lock - in the nat gas side on the us market side .
c . the book we are setting up will be based on many managerial assumptions
regarding sources of lng , shipping rates , schedules , etc . i would set up a
big prudence reserve
in case we mark it to market .
d . my group will work on valuation of some options we have in the elba island
deal
( that are good for enron ) and on the hedging strategy for the lng positions .
long - term lng contracts are typically based on the japanese crude cocktail
that
correlates very well with brent .

vince
i haven ' t spoken to you for awhile but hope the world is treating you well .
anyway with greg moving to his
new role i have ( i hope only temporarily ) staff trading oversight for the
eastern hemishere plus lng .
i understand that your group is taking a first cut at developing curves for
lng and lng ship values . i also understand
that another lng ship decision is on the dockets for may 19 ( not very far
away ) . anway i understand this
is a big decision but i still have gotten very little info yet . can you
please let me know where you stand now ?
i will ask my assistant lauren to set up a time that i can speak with you in
the next couple of days and if you
have anything for me to review before then she can get it faxed to me as well .

deborah ,
can you provide lillian with a floor plan so that she can start locating the hpl staff by function . also , what do you recommend regarding furniture ? we should be able to come up with an interim solution based on the space coming available in 3 allen or any additional furniture we have in warehouses or in the louisiana bldg . your thoughts on cost for this ?
once we have a plan / schedule i will follow up with aep to let them know of our plans . they already know we are headed in this direction , given their delay in leasing space .

subject : possible temporary move of hpl to 1201 louisiana
i finished the walk through of the 15 th floor space located at 1201 louisiana this afternoon . on the walk through with me were paul foust ( facilities ) , robert humlicek , jeffrey vincent and andrew hawthorn . i previously talked with deborah bubenko and vincent fox about this space . comments from the review are as follows :
most of the floor is composed of offices with some large group areas ( conference rooms etc . ) included . the floor can accommodate up to 150 people . however , with this amount of people in the area , space will be very tight . almost all offices will need to hold at least two people . large offices will need to hold three or four . the larger areas will need to have cubicles installed to make complete use of the space . with maximum doubling up in the offices , you might fit a couple of conference rooms on the floor with one kitchen area . there are nooks just off some of the hallways that would accommodate several network printers .
as tommy stated in his earlier e - mail on the allen center space , the fire code will require us to put a strobe in each office with multiple occupants .
one area of concern is the amount of furniture currently on the floor . the floor plan shows approximately 90 desks on the floor . some offices were locked so we could not verify the total . however , this number appears correct . also , for the most part , there were only desks in the offices unless they were occupied . chairs , filing cabinets , credenzas , etc . would needed to be added to this space . we need to determine where the additional furniture will come from .
there is one large area with 11 cubicles forming a circle . according to paul , this was the area where telephones were answered for the previous tenant . this might work for the trading area . the room appears to have the most telephone connectivity , is open , and would accommodate up to 11 .
if we decide trader telephones are necessary ( record conversations etc . ) , the cost associated with the purchase of the equipment and the necessary installation time will need to be factored into our schedule .
the floor has two data closets . at least one of the closets has 24 hour air conditioning according to vincent .
this floor has the same server connectivity at the three allen center space . a 100 meg single mode fiber connection serves this space .
robert has informed me that the floor currently has switches to support up to 200 ports . however , this does not mean that the drops to all offices are complete . probably some cabling will need to be added . it appears that the space can accommodate up to 150 users even with the extra ports needed for network printers , laptops , etc . however , if we need to accommodate more than 200 ports , additional switches can be added .
in summary , the floor space at 1201 louisiana looks as good or better than the space that was being considered at three allen center .

while i was at hsb , i designed an insurance or reinsurance financial model
that hsb uses for new product development , pricing different reinsurance
strategies , computing stochastic earnings forecast , and estimating
probabilistic maintenance & repair costs . the code , written in visual basic &
ms access belongs to hsb , and i want to replicate it here for our use at
enron . i would like to arrange a time to specifically talk to you and perhaps
vasant who was briefed on the model , about how we can use your group for the
analytical and programming support to get this model re - constructed .
i have screen outputs from the code and vasant thought the re - design and
construction here at enron is a problem that your group can do . could you let
me know when we can setup an hour to discuss ?

investment opportunity
market and growth potential of online gaming
it is estimated that in excess of a trillion dollars is wagered
annually worldwide on the various forms of gambling . the growth
of the internet has far exceeded the growth of any other communication
medium in the 20 th century . in just under four years the internet
has reached penetration rates that took the television 13 years
to reach and the radio over 30 years .
internet gambling has grown from 30 sites and bets of $ 17 million
in 1996 to approximately $ 3 billion in wagers in the year 2000 ,
according to the center for policy initiatives
a may 26 , 2002 article in thestreet . com noted that according
to christiansen capital advisors , a new york consulting firm that
tracks the gaming industry , gambling web sites took in $ 3 . 5 billion
in revenue during 2001 .
an april 29 , 2002 business week article noted that web
surfers will wager an estimated $ 11 . 4 billion this year and that
all over europe , internet surfers are visiting gambling and gaming
sites in record numbers , helping online betting become one of
the fastest growing businesses on the net .
bear stearns anticipates an estimated $ 6 billion in revenues
by u . s . wagerers alone , by 2003 .
a press release put out by aspinalls , a leading online gambling
operator , indicated that international online gambling revenues
were set to grow to $ 20 . 8 billion in 2005 , based upon an extensive
research report put out by greenfield online .
research firm datamonitor forecasts that revenues from gambling
will soar to $ 20 . 8 billion by 2005 .
while the u . s . has been the dominant market for the internet to date ,
statistics from nua ltd . indicate that approximately 25 percent of
internet users are from europe and 15 percent are from the asia pacific .
estats , inc . , on online provider and assembler of the internet research ,
believes that the major international growth areas will be in europe ,
led by germany , the uk , sweden , france , asia / pacific rim , especially
japan , australia , taiwan , and new zealand . western europe , with 14
million people online , accounting for 18 % of the worlds total ,
represents the next big growth opportunity of the net . asia , led by
japan , is a booming market for online users , e - commerce and advertising
dollars . estats , inc . further estimates that asia and the pacific
rim region hold 8 million of the worlds net users , nearly 11 %
of the worlds total . according to paul budde communications
the online population in asia , estimated at 5 to 10 million , comprises
only 0 . 4 % of the total population in that region . due to the population
of asia versus its lack of online household penetration , the long - term
potential for growth is astronomical . the baker report was quoted
as saying , we believe our projections of internet gambling
revenues of us $ 100 to us $ 200 billion domestically and us $ 200 to us $ 400
billion in the rest of the world by 2005 is reasonable , even conservative .
in an aug . 1 prnewswire - first call press release - angelciti entertainment ,
inc . announced that it will be initiating operations of a chinese
based language online casino , and will be adding additional asian - language - based
websites , entering asia ' s multi - billion dollar gaming market .
additional growth potential
it is universally agreed that the next big evolution is the adaptation
of the wireless internet and most professionals predict this will
occur over the next several years . moreover , online gambling has continued
to grow internationally as even more people gain access to the internet .
these events will materially increase our opportunities to reach the
gaming public and convert even more users toward angelcitis
licensed casinos .
with regard to wireless growth , angelcitis licensed casinos
can acquire more online game time from users waiting to catch their
planes , which are delayed for appointments , and the like , by providing
them with the easy use of our entertainment over their cell phone
or wireless pda . moreover , they can acquire additional users in the
form of computer phobic people who feel perfectly comfortable using
their mobile phone . we strongly feel that the next generation of wireless
products will serve to only further fuel the meteoric growth of the
online gaming industry and that angelcitis licensed casinos
will enjoy the fruits of that evolution .
the market for online gaming in europe and asia has been growing even
more rapidly than the us market an in a april 29 , 2002 business week
article noted that all over europe , internet surfers are visiting
gambling and gaming sites in record numbers , helping online betting
become one of the fastest growing businesses on the net . and
yet the online casino providers catering to these markets have grown
more slowly than those servicing english - speaking countries . to keep
up with growing international demand , angelciti has plans to bring

executive summary
? california ' s bond inevitability
? davis faces even greater financial woes
? california ' s creditor status debated by court
? windfall profits tax bill ( sb lx / ab 128 x ) passes senate vote , davis expected to sign off
california bond battle
sb 31 x passed the senate today by a simple majority vote , initiating the 90 day wait period on the revenue bonds issuance . sources indicate that contrary to media reports , a possible referendum on the sb 31 x would be unlikely for harvey rosenfield to produce within 90 days due to insufficient funding . he reportedly would need to raise $ 250 , 000 - $ 500 , 000 very quickly . sources believe that it is more likely that harvey will attempt to set up an initiative later this year or in 2002 .
davis financial woes just beginning
it is unclear whether governor davis truly will be able to move money around within the state budget to cover power purchases until august . of the $ 13 . 4 billion bond amount authorized , approximately $ 6 . 7 billion has already been spent on power . it is likely that the state will spend more than the remaining $ 6 . 7 billion on power before the bonds are even issued . sources indicate that most of the long - term contracts davis talks about are unsigned and not really in place . this means that the state may still have to purchase the majority of power on the spot market , which further complicates the situation . as reported earlier , this explains why the republicans wanted to wait for davis to disclose the terms of the contracts before authorizing the bond issuance . given the lack of contracts in place , it appears that the bridge loan and the bonds will be inadequate for all of the state ' s power purchases .
"" to be or not to be , "" is california a creditor ?
sources indicate that lawyers and members of the generator community reviewing california ' s revenue bond bill sb 31 x , are unclear as to whether the state of california has claims as a creditor . it appears at this time , that the assembly re - wrote senator bowen ' s language so that the bill relies on the existing interpretation of ab lx as to when the state gets paid by the utilities . this exact issue is currently being reviewed in the pg & e bankruptcy case and will most likely settle this ongoing dispute between legislatures and utilities .
windfall profits tax
according to sources , the windfall profits tax bill , sb lx , still remains in committee in the assembly . it is unclear if this bill could be brought to a vote tomorrow given that each house has not reviewed the other ' s version of the bill . sources further indicate that the senate version sb lx , has not yet been referred to an assembly policy committee and that a "" significant reconciliation process "" between the two bills must occur . for example , unlike the senate version , the assembly version reportedly does not set a price cap based on a firm dollar amount , but instead leaves the decision up to a regulatory committee such as the puc . once the bond issuance passes the senate and is officially authorized , the state will likely be able to get its bridge loan from the lenders . however , sources indicate that the bridge loan is "" dead "" unless the senate moves before thursday .",ham

create an intellectual team here at stanford to look at these problems .
i must move ahead soon to put the project in place and get the work going .

dear friend :

marketing program that will make you many thousands of $ $ in
the next few months . the new features - a software program
for extracting email addresses and over 2 , 000 url ' s of
bulletin boards , plus links to other many thousands of
places where such addresses can be extracted - all free .
take advantage of these new marketing tools and become rich
fast . please read carefully the entire message below and
enroll today .
as seen on national tv : this is the media report .
parents of 15 - year - old - find $ 71 , 000 cash hidden in his
closet ! ! !
does this headline look familiar ? of course it does .
you most likely have just seen this story recently featured
on a major nightly news program ( usa ) and reported
elsewhere in the world . his mother was cleaning and putting laundry
away when she came across a large brown paper bag that was
suspiciously buried beneath some clothes and a skateboard
in the back of her 15 - year - old son ' s closet .
nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when
she opened the bag and found it was full of cash .
five - dollar bills , twenties , fifties and hundreds - all
neatly rubber - banded in labeled piles .
"" my first thought was that he had robbed a bank "" , says the
41 - year - old woman , "" there was over $ 71 , 000 dollars in that
bag - that ' s more than my husband earns in a year "" .
the woman immediately called her husband at the
car dealership where he worked to tell him what she had
discovered . he came home right away and they drove together
to the boy ' s school and picked him up . little did they
suspect that where the money came from was more shocking
than actually finding it in the closet .
as it turns out , the boy had been sending out via email
a type of "" report "" to email addresses that he obtained off
the internet . everyday after school for the past 2 months ,
he had been doing this right on his computer in his
bedroom .
"" i just got the email one day and i figured what the heck .
i put my name on it like the instructions said and i
started sending it out "" , says the clever 15 - year - old .
the email letter listed 5 addresses and contained
instructions to send one $ 5 dollar bill to each person on
the list , then delete the address at the bottom and move the
others addresses down , and finally to add your name to the
top of the list .
the letter goes on to state that you would receive several
thousand dollars in five - dollar bills within 2 weeks , if you
sent out the letter with your name at the bottom of the
5 - address list . "" i get junk email all the time , and really
did not think it was going to work "" , the boy continues .
within the first few days of sending out the email , the
post office box that his parents had gotten him for his
video - game magazine subscriptions began to fill up with not
magazines , but envelopes containing $ 5 bills .
"" about a week later i rode my bike down to the post
office and my box had 1 magazine and about 300 envelopes
stuffed in it . there was also a yellow slip that said i had
to go up to the post office counter . ""
"" i thought i was in trouble or something "" . he goes
on , "" i went up to the counter and they had a whole box of
more mail for me . i had to ride back home and empty out my
backpack because i could not carry it all "" .
over the next few weeks , the boy continued sending out the
email . "" the money just kept coming in and i just kept
sorting it and stashing it in the closet , barely had time
for my homework "" . he had also been riding his bike to
several of the banks in his area and exchanging the $ 5
bills for twenties , fifties and hundreds .
"" i didn ' t want the banks to get suspicious so i kept riding
to different banks with like five thousand at a time in my
backpack . i would usually tell the lady at the bank counter
that my dad had sent me in to exchange the money and he was
outside waiting for me . one time the lady gave me a really
strange look and told me that she would not be able to do
it for me and my dad would have to come in and do it , but i
just rode to the next bank down the street . ""
surprisingly , the boy did not have any reason to be afraid .
a reporting news team examined and investigated the
so - called "" chain - letter "" the boy was sending out and found
that it was not a chain - letter at all . in fact , it was
completely legal according to us postal and lottery laws ,
title 18 , section 1302 and 1341 , or title 18 , section 3005
in the us code , also in the code of federal regulations ,
volume 16 , sections 255 and 436 , which state a product or
service must be exchanged for money received .
every five - dollar bill that he received contained a little
note that read , "" please send me report number xyx "" . this
simple note made the letter legal because he was exchanging
a service ( a report on how - to ) for a five - dollar fee .
[ this is the end of the media release . if you would like to
understand how the system works and get your $ 71 , 000 + -
please continue reading . what appears below is what the
15 - year - old was sending out on the net - you can use it too -
just follow the simple instructions ] .
dear friend :
"" making over half million dollars every 4 to 5 months from
your home for an investment of only $ 25 u . s . dollars
expense one time "" .
thanks to the computer age and the internet !
be a millionaire like others within a year ! !
before you say "" bull "" , please read the following .
this is the letter you have been hearing about on the news
lately . due to the popularity of this letter on the
internet , a national weekly news program recently devoted
an entire show to the investigation of this program
described below , to see if it really can make people money .
the show also investigated whether or not the program was
legal .
their findings proved once and for all that there are
"" absolutely no laws prohibiting the participation in the
program and if people can follow the simple instructions ,
they are bound to make some mega bucks with only $ 25 out of
pocket cost "" .
due to the recent increase of popularity & respect
this program has attained , it is currently working better
than ever .
this is what one had to say :
"" thanks to this profitable opportunity . i was approached
many times before but each time i passed on it . i am so
glad i finally joined just to see what one could expect in
return for the minimal effort and money required . to my
astonishment , i received a total $ 610 , 470 . 00 in 21 weeks ,
with money still coming in "" .
pam hedland , fort lee , new jersey .
here is another testimonial :
"" this program has been around for a long time but i never
believed in it . but one day when i received this again in
the mail i decided to gamble my $ 25 on it . i followed the
simple instructions and walaa . . . . . 3 weeks later the money
started to come in . first month i only made $ 240 . 00 , but the
next 2 months after that i made a total of $ 290 , 000 . 00 . so
far , in the past 8 months by re - entering the program , i
have made over $ 710 , 000 . 00 and i am playing it again .
the key to success in this program is to follow the simple
steps and not change anything . ""
more testimonials later but first ,
* * * * * * print this now for your future reference * * * * * * *
if you would like to make at least $ 500 , 000 every 4 to 5
months easily and comfortably , please read the following
. . . then read it again and again ! ! !
follow the simple instructions below and your financial
dreams will come true , guaranteed !
instructions :
* * * * order all 5 reports shown on the list below .
* * * * for each report , send $ 5 cash , the name & number of
the report you are ordering and your email address to the
person who ' s name appears on that list next to the report .
make sure your return address is on your envelope top left
corner in case of any mail problems .
* * * * when you place your order , make sure you order each of
the 5 reports . you will need all 5 reports so that you can
save them on your computer and resell them . your total cost
$ 5 x 5 = $ 25 . 00 .
* * * * within a few days you will receive , via email , each
of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals . save
them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to
send to the 1 , 000 ' s of people who will order them from you .
also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your
desk in case something happens to your computer .
* * * * important - do not alter the names of the people who
are listed next to each report , or their sequence on the
list , in any way other than what is instructed below in
steps 1 through 6 or you will loose out on a majority of your
profits . once you understand the way this works , you will
also see how it does not work if you change it .
remember , this method has been tested , and if you alter it ,
it will not work ! ! ! people have tried to put their
friends / relatives names on all five thinking they could get
all the money . but it does not work this way . believe us ,
we all have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened .
so , do not try to change anything other than what is
instructed . because if you do , it will not work for you .
remember , honesty reaps the reward ! ! !
1 . . after you have ordered all 5 reports , take this
advertisement and remove the name & address of the person
in report # 5 . this person has made it through the cycle
and is no doubt counting their fortune .
2 . . . . move the name & address in report # 4 down to
report # 5 .
3 . . . . move the name & address in report # 3 down to
report # 4 .
4 . . . . move the name & address in report # 2 down to
report # 3 .
5 . . . . move the name & address in report # 1 down to
report # 2
6 . . . . insert your name & address in the report # 1
position .
please make sure you copy every name & address
accurately !
take this entire letter , with the modified list of names ,
and save it on your computer . do not make any other
changes . save this on a disk as well just in case if you
loose any data .
to assist you with marketing your business on the internet ,
the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable
marketing information which includes how to send bulk
emails legally , where to find thousands of free classified
ads and much more .
there are 2 primary methods to get this venture going :
method # 1 : by sending bulk email legally
let ' s say that you decide to start small , just to see how
it goes , and we will assume you and those involved send out
only 5 , 000 emails each .
- - - - - -
now with the software program which you will receive for
free when you order report # 1 , it will be easier than ever to
collect fresh 5 , 000 , 10 , 000 or much more email addresses
for a few days work . no need anymore to pay for expensive
mailing lists that often are too old , or to have bulk mail
companies send your offer to again very often old
mailing lists . now your success will depend entirely on
you . along with the extract software , you will receive full
instructions how to use it , addresses of more than 2 , 000
bulletin boards and other places where you can extract .
plus other helpful information that will make you a great
success . all this will be included as an addition to report
# 1 . the software will be as an attachment to the same
report .
- - - - - -
let ' s also assume that the mailing receives only a 0 . 2 %
response ( the response could be much better , but let ' s just
say it is only 0 . 2 % . also many people will send out
hundreds of thousands of emails instead of only 5 , 000 each ) .
continuing with this example , you send out only 5 , 000
emails .
with a 0 . 2 % response , that is only 10 orders for report # 1 .
those 10 people responded by sending out 5 , 000 emails each
for a total of 50 , 000 . out of those 50 , 000 emails again only 0 . 2 %
responded with orders . that ' s 100 people responded and ordered
report # 2 . those 100 people mail out 5 , 000 emails each for a total
of 500 , 000 emails . the 0 . 2 % response to that is 1000 orders for
report # 3 . those 1000 people send out 5 , 000 emails each for a
total of 5 million emails sent out . the 0 . 2 % response to that
is 10 , 000 orders for report # 4 . those 10 , 000 people send out
5 , 000 emails each for a total of 50 , 000 , 000 ( 50 million ) emails .
the 0 . 2 % response to that is 100 , 000 orders for report # 5 .
that ' s 100 , 000 orders times $ 5 each = $ 500 , 000 . 00 ( half
million ) .
your total income in this example is :
1 . . . . . $ 50 +
2 . . . . . $ 500 +
3 . . . . . $ 5 , 000 +
4 . . . . . $ 50 , 000 +
5 . . . . . $ 500 , 000 . . . . . . . . . grand total = $ 555 , 550 . 00
numbers do not lie . get a pencil & paper and figure out the
worst possible responses and no matter how you calculate
it , you will still make a lot of money !
remember friend , this is assuming only 10 people ordering
out of 5 , 000 you mail . dare to think for a moment what
would happen if everyone , or half or even one 4 th of those
people mailed 100 , 000 emails each or more ? there are over
250 million people on the internet worldwide and counting .
believe me , many people will do just that , and more !
method # 2 : by placing free ads on the internet
advertising on the net is very , very inexpensive and there
are hundreds of free places to advertise . placing a lot of
free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response .
we strongly suggest you start with method # 1 and add
method # 2 as you go along .
for every $ 5 you receive , all you must do is email them
the report they ordered . that ' s it . always provide same day
service on all orders . this will guarantee that the email
they send out , with your name and address on it , will be
prompt because they can not advertise until they receive
the report .
order each report by its number & name only .
notes : always send $ 5 cash ( u . s . currency ) for each report .
( euro or english pounds also are accepted ) checks not
accepted . make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in
at least 2 sheets of paper . on one of those sheets of
paper , write the number & the name of the report you are
ordering , your email address and your name and postal
address .

"" my name is mitchell . my wife , jody and i live in chicago .
i am an accountant with a major u . s . corporation and i make
pretty good money . when i received this program i grumbled
to jody about receiving ' ' junk mail ' ' . i made fun of the
whole thing , spouting my knowledge of the population and
percentages involved . i ' ' knew ' ' it wouldn ' t work . jody
totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later
she jumped in with both feet . i made merciless fun of her ,
and was ready to lay the old ' ' i told you so ' ' on her when
the thing didn ' t work . well , the laugh was on me ! within 3
weeks she had received 50 responses . within the next 45
days she had received a total of $ 147 , 200 . 00 all cash ! i
was shocked . i have joined jody in her ' ' hobby ' ' . ""

"" not being the gambling type , it took me several weeks to
make up my mind to participate in this plan . but
conservative that i am , i decided that the initial
investment was so little that there was just no way that i
wouldn ' t get enough orders to at least get my money back . i
was surprised when i found my medium size post office box
crammed with orders . i made $ 319 , 210 . 00 in the first 12
weeks . the nice thing about this deal is that it does not
matter where people live . there simply isn ' t a better
investment with a faster return and so big . ""

later i wondered if i should have given it a try . of
course , i had no idea who to contact to get another copy ,
so i had to wait until i was emailed again by someone
else . . . . . . . . . 11 months passed then it luckily came
again . . . . . . i did not delete this one ! i made more than
$ 490 , 000 on my first try and all the money came within 22

money with little cost to you . i followed the simple

i ' ve seen a list where you nominate a set of business sponsors to represent na interests , and it appears that the intention is to have single points of contact for each of the budget buckets .
however , there are a number of horizontal initiatives , such as global data , that cut across all of them .
is it your intention that we take the horizontals to all the people listed , or will you nominate one to evaluate the budget numbers ?

"montana oi | and gas , inc . ( mogi ) to expiore further opportunities in
aiberta canada , is an energy developer in canada ' s most highly coveted
reservoirs .
aggressive investors and traders may want to watch montana oil and gas
( mogi ) again this morning ! montana oil and gas inc . ( mogi - news )
announces that the syivan lake oil and gas project is still awaiting a
rig at this time . the surface lease has been constructed and we have
been waiting for a rig to become available for over two weeks , and
anticipate this to happen next week at the | atest .
the company has a 25 % working interest in the sylvan lake project .
symbol - mogi
price - . 40
reasons to conside mogi :
1 . price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest bu | |
market in a generation .
2 . natural gas prices have tripied in the last two years .
3 . with multipie projects in high - gear and the expanding production on
reserves potentia | | y worth muiti - miliions , mogi is selling for less
than 1 / 4 the value of its assets .
4 . montana oi | and gas speciaiizes in using new technology to turn
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitable enterprises . aiready
shares in the oil and gas sectorare rising faster than the overa | |
market . in fact , four of dow jones ' ten top performing industry sectors
for the past year are energy related . but it ' s in the mid - sized
expiorers and developers like montana oil ( mogi ) that the biggest gains
are being made . in the last 12 months , many of these stocks made tripie
and even quadrupie returns .
vancouver , british coiumbia , march 30 , 20 o 5 ( primezone ) - - montana oi |
and gas , inc . , ( pink sheets : mogi ) president peter sanders is please to
announce the foliowing update on its sylvan lake project .
after severa | delays due to unseasonabie weather and road ciosures in
the province of alberta , the contracted driiling rig was moved onto
| ocation
over the weekend and ensign driliing has spudded the 5 - 3 - 38 - 3 w 5 m well
a
nd are currently dri | | ing at 1 , 250 feet . surface casing will be run to
930 feet . the dri | | ing rig is known as a teiescopic double and is rated
to driil to lo , oo 0 feet in depth . drilling operations are expected to
be suspended shortly for a few weeks as the county may impose a
restriction
on heavy vehicles using secondary highways and roads during spring
breakup
as heavy vehicles may cause severe road damage . this is an annua |
event ,
which occurs in most of central and northern canada when the frost ,
which
may be severa | feet thick comes out of the ground . driiling operations
for
a large rig such as the syivan lake weil requires service by heavy
vehicles
such as mud , water , cement and vacuum trucks which will be prohibited
from
using the roads during this period of time . peter sanders notes ,
§ the road bans that have been taking place al | over alberta happen
every year
and in the spring is no surprise , ail oi | and gas companies are
effected by
breakup , the good thing is , is that we have the rig on site , which wil |
remain there unti | we are finished driiling , surface casing has been
completed and we wiil be ready to finish drilling the minute the road
bans are lifted .
the syivan lake prospect is a well defined 3 - d seismic structura | high
within a preserved pekisko remnant island that may have virgin
reservoirs
with similar production potentia | as the adjacent n poo | where 6 wells
have
produced 68 o , 00 o barrels oil since 1997 . in overall , the syivan fieid
has
produced 40 miliion barreis of oil from the pekisko formation and 50
biliion
cubic feet of gas from the shunda formation .
ensign driiling wiil test a tota | of 30 feet from several zones in the
shunda
formation at 7 , 155 feet and a 30 - foot pekisko oil formation at 7 , 32 o
feet .
when dri | | ing resumes , the hoie is planned to reach a total depth of
7 , 57 o feet ,
which may take some 10 days to then complete driiling and testing .
each development weil has probable production of 150 barreis of oi | per
day
and 750 ? thousand cubic feet gas per day with reserves in excess of 1
biliion
cubic feet gas and 30 o , ooo barrels of oil . there are four other pay
zones that
are prospective for gas . the average weil in the sylvan lake fieid has
produced
5 oo barreis of oil per day and / or over one million cubic feet of gas
per day .
if successfu | , the company intends to dri | | up to 4 more weils on these
| and
sections . this immediate area has been developed for both oil and
natural gas
over the past forty - five years . accordingly a multitude of gas
gathering and
processing facilities and oi | transportation faciiities have been
constructed .

christy , i think there is a good chance that the information shown below
went to you , or your office .
i would like to get involved in finalizing plans for revenue distribution
for the n . padre production . i am certain you are way ahead of me on this
matter . spinnaker expects a division order title opining within a few
weeks . i also expect the attorney to make some title requirements which
will delay a final opinion . in talking with ranger and the houston
exploration company , they are prepared to receive their gross ( shown below )
and be responsible to their respective orri owners .
how do you recommend we proceed ? will hpl pay taxes on behalf of the
parties ?
when you get a minute , please call me at 713 / 759 - 1770 .

we are sending this investor bu | | etin revealing the most undervalued
issue on the otcbb to our mi | | ions of subscribers for substantia | gains
immediately . geec has experienced a recent spike in price and voiume
indicating heavy accumuiation of shares . this is a sign of even bigger
things to come for this emerging worid leader in the conversion of
waste
materials into eiectrical energy , an industry with such high global
demand that it is impossible to assign a vaiue to the size of the
market .
geec is utiiizing the unique proprietary technoiogy of their biosphere
process system for the disposal of a wide variety of waste products at
5 to 7 tons per hour , making a major impact on the gioba | waste
problem . this profitabie and environmentaliy safe process converts into
clean ,
"" green "" electricity such waste materiais as municipa | soiid waste ,
agricuitural wastes , forestry wastes , medical wastes , industrial
wastes ,
sewage siudge , shale oil , sour natural gas , and the huge market of used
tires .
geec generates 5 to lo mega - watts per hour of electricity from the
waste conversion on a continuous basis which is then soid to repienish
the
| oca | or national grid .
the biosphere process succeeds in fiiling an worldwide need for
cost - effective renewabie energy sources and a corresponding universa |
need to
soive critical probiems in the disposa | of waste . geec has secured
internationa | acceptance for a revoiutionary product designed to
significantiy impact the gioba | waste problem whiie a major push for
generating
electricity from aiternative sources continues to be the hot topic due
to shortages and massive power failures .
geec just announced a lo biilion , 5 - year joint venture with chinese
government - operated companies , inciuding yanzhou coa | mining ( nyse -

deployed throughout china to fulfil | an need for waste disposa | and
energy
generation , two critica | areas for a country with a population
exceeding 1 . 3 biliion peopie . as china ' s rapid economic advance
continues , a
shortfal | of 50 o million kilowatts exists annuaily , prompting periodic
blackouts in al | chinese provinces . geec is in line to profit
substantia | | y while providing relief from unmanageable municpal solid
waste
disposa | and simuitaneousiy heiping china meet its energy needs .
the chairman of geec , former prime minister of ireland dr . aibert
reynolds , has secured a 2 billion lineofcredit for geec and opened
doors in
over a dozen countries through political contacts at the highest | eve | .
dr . reynolds internationa | stature has been instrumenta | in guiding
geec into a position of woridwide acceptance by embracing a major
foothold
on the gioba | waste probiem and the sweeping movement to generate
eiectricity from aiternative sources . dr . reynolds , who has previously
been
nominated for a nobe | peace prize , has surrounded himself with a
prestigious group of the worid ' s foremost professors and scientists .
their
collective achievements have garnered awards and medals while their
writings have appeared in hundreds of articles , journais , and books .
these
beacons of the scientific community are the guiding forces | eading geec
into the next era of gioba | waste remova | and the continuous generation
of energy .
the forecast for geec is crystal ciear , and this is just the tip of the
iceberg for this emerging woridwide leader where shares should be added
immediately to every portfolio . we expect a continuous fiow of huge
news announcements while shares stiil represent an uncommon vaiue for a

"hello my dear ,
before i introduce myself , i wish to inform you that this letter is not a hoax mail and i urge you to treat it serious . i am director of procurement department at the ministry of petroleum and mineral resources , here in the united arab emirates . i obtained your email while searching for a reliable person , who could assist me in receiving transfer of a supposed contract awarded funds . this fund came as a result of over estimated contract awarded sums executed by foreign contractors in the petroleum ministry . this fund has been approved for payment to the contractor by the concerned ministry . the contracts had been executed and commissioned . what i am about to receive now , is the over estimated funds which the contractor whom i helped during the process of obtaining the contracts added to his estimation for my own interest . this is a normal deal that goes in my ministry by top officials .
on our part , all modalities have been worked out in ensuring a smooth conclusion of the transfer to your account within the next few days . all i want from you is to receive this funds on my behalf , because as government official i cannot collect the funds directly from the contractor , neither i am allowed by law to operate / run foreign bank accounts . if you are trustworthy and can assist me in receiving the fund , do not hesitate to respond back to me immediately .
please note that there is no risk involved in receiving the funds in your account for and it will be done through wire transfer . i wish you to state in percentage what you shall have for the use of your account . as soon as you indicate your interest , further details and the amount involved shall be given to you once i hear from you . please , treat with utmost confidentiality .
looking forward to hearing from you soonest .

"joe and louise :
i was on a conf call today re erc financing . legal and finance were on the call . the consensus was that it would be difficult .
the structure involves selling the erc ' s at market to an entity controlled by the bank ; buying a call from that entity ; selling a put to that entity ; having a price swap ( fixed / floating ) with entity . the bank would also want to understand market liquidity , price transparency and the rules of every district we have erc ' s in . the texas sox deal recently put into this vehicle was much simpler in a more liquid market , but it took 4 months and $ 1 mm of legal fees to put together . the lawyers involved believe that it would be more difficult and likely more expensive for the california erc ' s - we have several districts and several products .
$ 1 mm + internal resources seems like a lot for a $ 20 mm - $ 30 mm balance with an expected term of one year - especially with uncertain success due to the price transparency issues ( no index price ) .
any thoughts ?

facekey . corporation
market information
symbol - feky
recent price : $ 0 . 40
key drivers
life after 9 / 11 finds america living with evils far
beyond our imagination
one biometric company ( facekey corp ) appears to be on the
forefront of making a difference . facekey corp . trading on the otc under
the ticker symbol feky . headquartered in san antonio texas , this
biometric company combines face and fingerprint recognition technology
which can be used in both the public and private sectors . coo annette
starkweather exclaims by effectively combining both fingerprint and
facial recognition , facekey is targeting the two largest revenue producing
areas in the biometrics industry today while establishing patented
technology to forge the future of biometric applications .
according to the international biometrics group ( ibg ) , an independent
market research firm , the total biometrics market was $ 730 million in
2003 . biometrics is anticipated to grow to approximately $ 4 . 8 billion by
2008 . fingerprint technology represents $ 1 . 4 billion and facial
recognition $ 802 million of that $ 4 . 8 billion . currently the biometric
industry is in its early stages of growth but we believe government
initiatives will act as a major catalyst towards global industry growth .
for example on january 5 th of this year the u . s . - visitor and immigrant
status indicator technology was implemented at 115 airports and 14 ship
terminals ,
requiring u . s . customs officials to digitally photograph and fingerprint
visa carrying foreign nationals data is compared against a government
database of possible terrorists with criminal histories ( source : msnbc ,
roland jones 1 / 20 / 04 ) . the program received $ 330 million for the fiscal
year 2004 .
biometrics is also used in the battle against occupational fraud . based on
2004 report findings by the association of certified fraud examiners ( acfe )
, the typical organization loses 6 percent of its annual revenues to
occupational fraud . if multiplied by the u . s . gdp , which in 2003 was just
under $ 11 trillion , it would translate into $ 660 billion in annual fraud
losses . this is why facekey through its innovative biometric technologies
is focusing much of its core business on fraud . government initiatives are
always plagued with delays due to slow or inconsistent standards of
development , lengthy technology reviews and public comment . to offset that
facekey has diversified into the private sector as well , proving that its
management team has the ability to find other niche areas where its
technology could be used to grow both bottom and top line numbers
continually . in fact in a press release issued january 18 , 2004 , annette
h . starkweather , facekey corp . coo goes on to say , ` ` on a recent trip to
las vegas , we discovered that casinos represent a largely underdeveloped
market that could benefit from facekey ' s biometric products . based on
discussions we have had with casino personnel , our multiple face tracking
software engine would greatly improve the speed and efficiency of current
surveillance methods used by many las vegas casinos to screen their crowds
for persons that could pose a security threat . .
due to an emerging global market and facekey ' s ability to target both
public and private sectors through there innovative facial and fingerprint
recognition technologies we believe this company has the ability increase
market share significantly . i think jp morgan ' s analyst paul coster says
it best when he wrote in his september 2 nd 2004 research report we think
biometrics looks like a rising tide that should lift all boats .
facekey . corporation
at a glance
facekey ' s
combination of
face and fingerprint recognition technology comprises of 60 % of the entire

several patent pending . for additional detail on product information go to

"good day .
dear friend ,
as you read this , i don ? t want you to feel sorry for
me , because , i believe everyone will die someday .
my name is hans leif jnr . a merchant in dubai ,
but i hail from norway . i have been diagnosed with
esophageal cancer . i am presently in a hospital in
london .
it has defiled all forms of medical treatment , and
right now i have only about a few months to live ,
according to medical experts .
i have not particularly lived my life so well , as i
never really cared for anyone ( not even myself ) but my
business . though i am very rich , i was never generous ,
i was always hostile to people and only focused on my
business as that was the only thing i cared for . but
now i regret all this as i now know that there is more
to life than just wanting to have
or make all the money in the world .
i believe when god gives me a second chance to come to
this world i would live my life a different way from
how i have lived it . now that god has called me , i
have willed and given most of my property and assets
to my immediate and extended family members as well as
a few close friends .
i want god to be merciful to me and accept my soul so ,
i have decided to give also to charity
organizations , as i want this to be one of the last
good deeds i do on earth . so far , i have distributed
money to some charity organizations in the u . a . e ,
algeria , malaysia and denmark . now that my health has
deteriorated so badly , i cannot do this myself
anymore .
i once asked members of my family to close
one of my accounts and distribute the money which i
have there to charity organization in bulgaria and
pakistan , they refused and kept the money to
themselves . hence , i do not trust them anymore , as
they seem not to be contended with what i have left
for them .
the last of my money which no one knows of is the huge
cash deposit of eighteen million dollars
$ 18 , 000 , 000 , 00 that i have with a fuditiary company . i
will want
you to help me collect
this deposit and dispatched it to charity
organizations . i have set aside 10 % for you and for
your time .
god be with you .

"ferc to examine more price mitigation
it is reported that ferc will be looking at hr 1974 by rep doug ose ( r - ca ) as the basis for expanding their mitigation efforts . basically it expands mitigation efforts to apply around the clock rather than in emergency instances . the letter from rep . tauzin to ferc chairman hebert which prompted hebert to call the meeting on monday is supported by 14 house republicans . at this time , it appears ferc is seriously considering expanding price mitigation to the wscc states . however , the administration still opposes price controls , and in case price controls are applied , secretary abraham yesterday inoculated against taking responsibility by saying "" ferc is an independent agency . . "" the ferc agenda will apparently examine at least four price mitigation cases california filed with ferc :
? extending ferc ' s current price mitigation efforts to all wscc states and amending the current price limits applicability - - now in effect only during stage three power emergencies in california - - to 24 hours a day , seven days a week .
? requiring power generators in the entire western region to sell available electricity to california or into their local power grids during emergencies , reducing the threat of blackouts .
? establishing a regional framework for large power users to sell electricity back into the grid during peak usage times . some companies that have long - term power contracts at low rates may be able to make money by scaling back their operations and selling electricity .
? expanding an order issued last year that authorized refunds for excessive markups during the most extreme power emergencies . that refund order would now apply to excessive prices during all power emergencies .
attached below is rep . tauzin ' s letter to commissioner hebert and likewise hrl 974 .",ham

following our telephone conversation , please find attached a summary of

expected this year . the conference will be held in houston on thursday 16 th

be happy to consider any of the available sessions or if you have a session
that you feel is currently missing from the programme , do not hesitate to

i have attached a file that gives an indication of the topics that have been
identified so far . although i have bullet points for the sessions i would
first like to identify interested parties and then work with them to develop
a session that reflects their particular expertise and experience . i also
think that by continuously developing the points we can make greater
allowances for continuity between each participant .

i look forward to speaking with you soon .

subject : carthage plant imbalance
i ' ve discussed the carthage plant imbalance with chad cass at duke energy
( carthage plant operator ) and willie shannon at devon energy and here is what
i ' ve learned . duke and devon met last fall to discuss the imbalance , which
according to devon was approximately 240 , 000 due to duke at 8 / 31 / 99 . devon
acknowledged that an imbalance existed but didn ' t think it was that high .
both
parties seemed to take the position that the other side needed to prove them
wrong . according to duke the imbalance grew by 120 , 000 in september , 16 , 000
in
october , and another 12 , 000 in november ( all round numbers ) bringing the total
to approximately 395 , 000 through the end of november . based on current month
estimates , duke thinks january sales are 1 , 000 - 2 , 000 / day higher than
production , and would like to see a cut in sales of 4 , 000 / day effective friday
1 / 21 / 00 in order to balance for the month of january . again devon disagrees
with this daily overage , based on their production estimates , but since they
recognize an imbalance exists , willie @ devon has agreed to reduce the volume
available for sale by 4 , 000 / day effective friday the 21 st . this will reduce
the amount of "" excess "" gas ( gas daily - priced ) that enron has available to sell
at carthage .
additionally , beginning february lst duke requests payback to the plant of
5 , 000 / day , continuing until the imbalance is worked off . devon should reduce
their lst of the month availabe volume by 5 , 000 / d to accomplish this , and
enron
needs to verify if that reduction is factored into the numbers when they are
setting up february activity .
a key point to this imbalance issue , and one that i believe all of the parties
agree on , is that ces , now enron , purchases devon ' s carthage gas at the
tailgate of the plant , so any production - related imbalance is between devon
and
the plant ( duke ) and make - up volumes only reduce what enron receives from
devon . enron is not buying the gas from devon and turning around and paying
back a historical imbalance . however , since ces ( and now enron ) is set up as
devon ' s agent at carthage , duke communicates the imbalance information and
coordinates make - up arrangements with enron . enron in turn needs to verify
with devon that devon has adjusted their available volumes to reflect any
make - up . hopefully once actual make - up commences , devon and duke will strive
to reconcile to an actual imbalance that they both agree on .
please call me if you have any questions @ ( 713 ) 693 - 2581 .

he sold 230 megawatts each hour to aep . he used the proper terminology unique to ercot and sold the energy at a decent price .
he maintained good , detailed notes and was able to relay this information to me the following monday .

"dear sir ,
i am mrs mariam abacha , wife of the late nigerian
head of state , general sani abacha who died on
the 8 th
of june 1998 while still on active duty . i am
contacting you in view of the fact that we will
be of
great assistance to each other likewise
developing a
cordial relationship .
i currently have within my reach the sum of
thirty
six million united states dollars
( us $ 36 , 000 , 000 ) in
cash , which i intend to use for investment
purposes
specifically in your country . this money came
as a
result of a payback contract deal between my
late
husband and a russian firm on our country ' s
multi - billion dollars ajaokuta steel plant . the
russian partners returned my husbands share of
us $ 36 , 000 , 000 after his death and lodge it with
my
late husband ' s security company in nigeria of
which i
am a director . right now the new civilian
government
have intensified their probe on my husband ' s
financial
resources and they have revoked our licenses
that
allows us to own a financial and oil company .
in view
of this , i acted very fast to withdraw the
us $ 36 , 000 , 000 from the company ' s vault and
deposited
it in a privately erected security safe abroad .
no record ever existed concerning the money
neither is
the money traceable by the government because
there is
no documentation showing that we received the
money
from the russians .
due to the current situation in the country
concerning
government attitude towards my family , it has
become
quite impossible for me to make use of this
money
within , thus i seek assistance to transfer this
money
into your safe bank account . on your consent , i
shall expect
you to contact me urgently to enable us discuss
details of this transaction .
bearing in mind that your assistance is needed
to
transfer the funds , i propose a commission of
20 % of
the total sum to you for the expected services
and
assistance . your urgent response is highly
needed so
as to stop further contacts . all correspondent
should be forwarded to this email : zenab . m @ ompadec . zzn . con
or you can call my son mobile : hamza 234 - 8023137978 i use this
opportunity to implore you to exercise the most
utmost
indulgence to keep this matter extra ordinarily
confidential what ever your decision while i
await your
prompt response .
best personal regards ,
mrs mariam abacha .

dear sir / madam ,
in case you have received this mail earlier , kindly ignore this mail . it may have
been re - sent to you by mistake . ours is not a mailing list and we have no intention of sending any regular mails to anybody .
we have devised a set of systems , which can reduce the damage caused to vehicles and deaths and injury caused to passengers and pedestrians in vehicular accidents by more than
seventy - five percent
we have already filed and are in process of filing further , multiple and appropriate disclosure documents , provisional patent applications at the united states patent & trademarks office ( uspto ) , and also applications under the patent co - operation treaty at world intellectual property organization ( wipo ) at geneva .
there is absolutely no doubt that our idea is new and innovative . moreover , we are very confident and very sure that this will help reducing / minimizing human suffering to a very large extent . there is no doubt that the product devised by us will change the face of the earth forever . brief details relating to our product are detailed in the annexures under the following headings :
statistics advantages
options
economics
we are looking for the followings :
01 . business consultancy and advice regarding the most viable , practical and profitable course of action under the circumstances and also consultancy on patents one person moderately injured every three seconds ; one person mildly injured every three seconds . )
( c ) current yearly automobile sales worldwide - more than 1000 billion us $ .
( d ) number of automobiles worldwide - more than 1000 billion pieces
( e ) daily loss caused due to vehicular accidents worldwide
more than 2 billion us $ per day .
( 2 % of the worldwide gross national product of more than 36500 billion us $ = more than 730 us $ per year = more than 2 billion us $ per day )
theadvantages of the technology developed by us :
a . the introduction of such technology will dramatically reduce the expenses of auto - insurance . this reduction of insurance cost will be at par with or even more that the expenses incurred towards the introduction of such technology in modern day vehicles . accordingly , the life insurance premier will also undergo drastic reduction . additionally , because of saving of lives , the outgo of the insurance companies will reduce substantially .
b . as per the who studies and projections , road accidents occupy the number nine positions by way of causes of death in the world today . it is projected by who that by the year 2020 they will occupy the number three positions , next only to heart disease and depression .
by introduction of this technology , we are sure that this will not happen . on the contrary there will be massive reduction in the number of deaths due to road accidents and road accidents may not figure on the list of major causes of death , in the year 2020 at all .
c . this technology will therefore , make all vehicles cheaper and safer . not only will the cost be reduced , safety which is priceless in itself , will also be greatly enhanced .
as and when the regular patent application is filed and patent is granted , the life of the patent will be 20 years . even at the current levels , with road accidents placed at number nine on the who list as a major cause of death , there is a daily loss of two billion us $ . even at the present level , over a period of twenty years , without any interest and without any compounding , this loss works out to be :
2 billion us $ x 365 days x 20 years - 14 , 600 billion us $ .
d . our technology will ensure that at least seventy - five percent of the above losses are prevented . such figure works out to be more that 10 , 000 billion us $ . it is important to note that this is the projection at the current level . as per the future projections , the incidents of road accidents are expected to increase . hence , the figure is likely to be increase very substantially . in addition the time factor and the interest factor will inflate this figure further .
e . at the current levels , more than 1 . 2 million persons are dying every year due to road accidents . even at the current rates , more than 24 million lives will be lost in road accidents over the next twenty years ( i . e . life of the patent , when granted ) . besides , at the current levels .
3 . 2 million people are injured every year . in the next twenty years , the number of people injured due to road accident , will therefore be more than half a billion .
f . if we add to that the personal , physical and psychological traumas to those directly involved in and also to those who are associated with the people involved in the road accidents . the trauma and the misery and henceforth the value of the savings , are all unmeasurable in quantities , presently known to human kind .
g . considering the figures and dynamics as explained hereinabove , it may not be improper or out of place to compare this technology with the introduction of electricity , computer or aircrafts in terms of its value to mankind .
h . the benefits of this technology will be so obvious and essential that , in the very near future , the use of this technology will become unavoidable . it should and will become mandatory by law , to install such technology and the installation of such technology should and will be a pre - requisite for granting or renewal of the registration and license of all vehicles in future .
i . as described hereinabove ; this technology and its utility are incomparable , outthought of , and unheard of till date . it will open a new floodgate in human travel and safety measures . in future , it can and will be applied to other mode of transport , like aircrafts and trains also .
. among other things , we have the following options available to us : - options
available to us : -
a - outright sale
( a ) immediate outright sale of the idea and the concept along with our filed applications for one time lump sum consideration .
( b ) further development of the concept and further filing of patent and all patent related applications , before taking steps as outlined in "" a "" .
the process ( b ) will obviously increase the realization in terms of price .
b - licencing options
i ) new vehicles - granting of licenses to manufacturers of automobiles , individually or collectively , all over the world for incorporation in the automobiles to be manufactured in future on fixed time or per piece basis .
ii ) conversion of existing vehicles - to independent agents for conversion of the existing more than 1000 billion vehicles all over the world .
c - combined options
a collaborative arrangement with some private and / or government agency wherein we receive a certain down payment and then jointly distribute the licensing rights on a pre - decided sharing ( partnership ) arrangement .
the economics of the project will be as follows : -
1 ) in case any / all processes and systems described by us are incorporated in the design of new vehicles and the new vehicles are manufactured in accordance with the modified designs , the cost escalation may not be more than 5 % to 8 % , and the safety and the protection will be ten times ( more than ) the price escalation . hence , drop in insurance premier will compensate for the cost escalation .
2 ) in case , the existing vehicles are modified , the cost involved will be approximately 10 % to 15 % of the value of the vehicle .
but partial modifications at a lower cost , which will give partial protection , may also be carried out . as a thumb rule , the cost of modification in percentage terms will be about one fifth of the percentage of safety and protection provided .
3 ) in case the value of the vehicles is low or the life of the vehicle is about to expire , the partial modifications may be practically and economically viable , as incorporation onto a new vehicle is relatively less expensive and more protective .
4 ) there are more than 1000 billion motor vehicles in the world at present . besides there are an unspecified number of non - motorized ehicles .
5 ) almost all of them can be converted in phased manner to a variable degree . the cost of conversion will be directly proportional to their current market value and the safety shield to be generated there from .
6 ) among the motorised vehicles , the conversion cost may work out of few dollars for every percent of safety shield created the exact calculation can be worked out , but over all , some of the methods may provide more safety at lower cost compared to the other which may differ in efficiency .
7 ) even if we consider a very vague and approximate cost of conversion of 300 us $ per vehicle , the conversion industry works out to be worth 3 , 00 , 000 billion us $ .
8 ) realising the potential of the product in terms of human safety , it will be reasonable to presume that majority of such conversion will be completed over a period of three years from the starting date .
9 ) as pointed hereinabove , the size of the conversion industry may be estimated to , in the range of 1 , 00 , 000 billion us $ per year over the next three years .
10 ) alternatively , considering the diversity of available motorised vehicles all over the world , conversion licensing can also be commercially viable proposition . for such conversion , licenses can be granted on - line , on receipt of on - line payments . in that case , different rates for granting conversion to vehicles having specific registration numbers can be granted in accordance with and in proportion to the size , carrying capacity and the engine power of the vehicle .
11 ) in case , licensing is done , the creation and installation of the concerned systems will be done by the end - user , as per his circumstances and needs . however , piracy is likely to be a major problem in such licensing .
12 ) it is likely that as and when the systems are introduced in the motorised vehicles , unusual and unprecedented demand of new vehicles is created . this will result in massive rejection of the vehicles currently playing all over the world and stimulate an entirely new market as far as motorised vehicle is concerned . the size of such market is difficult to either comprehend and / or estimate .
p . s .
1 ) some of the figures have been rounded off but generally the figures are correct .
2 ) we have tried to keep this communication brief and to the point . more details , including website references are available with us and can be provided , if required .

"i updated the june transport usage tickets today through hpl , and will be
finishing these tickets tomorrow . rates have been updated to reflect current
matrix rates and all baseload rates that i know of at this time . i have not
yet received third party transport rates , so if you know of any , please let
me know . also , i have zeroed out some volumes on some tickets for june , so
your schedulers will have to update volumes as they know them . rule of thumb
was that if i had to add a month , i refreshed the rate but left volume at
zero . if the months were already on the ticket , then i refreshed the rate
and left the volume as is .
i would advise that your schedulers check volumes on all pipes to ensure
they ' re reflected in position manager correctly . please let me know if you

"good morning all :
the question has arisen as to whether enron has "" personal days "" , that ,
you can take in case of repair problems at home ; car problems ; sick spouse ,
sick child , etc .
i checked with hr and the policy manual and the answer is "" no "" , but they
can be designated at the discretion of the supervisor . i talked this over
with vince and he has decided that the research group will be allowed
two ( 2 ) personal days per year to take care of personal business and
not have to take a vacation day , discretionary day , or leave of absence .
if you have advance notice ( such as an air conditioner repair scheduled ) ,
please let me know when you are going to take these days . if an
emergency arises with no notice , please call in and let me know that you
are taking a personal day . it will be coded on your time sheet .
these two personal days will in no way cancel or take the place of , "" funeral
leave "" , "" family leave "" , or "" civic duty leave "" . they are just a way of being
able to take care of repair problems and other personal problems that arise .
these should be very beneficial and i am sure very much appreciated by
all of us .
if you have any questions , please call me .

subject : re : tw flow direction
dennis ,
i do not have anything documented in any detail yet . lindyis out on vacation & i lknow i will be reviewing the requirments with her . i will be working on the flow direction requirements over the next 2 to 3 maybe 4 weeks . after discussing with hasan , we plan to implement in the december / january time frame so that it moves in with tw ' s new contract system . this flow direction project was part of the tw 2001 system enhancement budget dollars . i know that at the cms status update meeting last week lisa noted these two items for tw . also noted was a comment about needing the details on the winthin and outside the path . the within and outside the path is already coded in the current cbs system and ple system . you should be able to pull from the current system the process . i know it will need to merge into the new system . the basic concept is as follows :
all points on tw are tied to a marketing lateral code .
this code is stored in ple for each point on tw
a batch process is set up in cbs that is a stored procedure that runs everyday at 12 : 00 noon to calculate the inside / outside the paths on all firm contracts . ( release , fts 3 , ftsl , lft , efbh ) . this process finds the marketing lateral for the primary receipt and primary delivery pionts & identifies all possible laterals between the primary receipt to primary delivery that can be valid alternate points inside the path and stores those to be used in the allocation process . it maps it out for each firm contract . this process is uses the valid marketing laterals to build the inside alternate paths . any contract whose alternate receipt or alternate delvery point that is not in the valid available marketing lateral is an outside the path transaction . tms uses this process in the allocations on tw .
with revalidation the tms system checks for contracts that change primary receipt points and delivery points in the evening , nongrid , i / dl , and i / d 2 cycles . however the stored procedure batch job is a maunal process , the contract team would submit this batch job on demand so that it can identify the valid marketing laterals for that specific contract that was changed . i would like to see this automated with the new cms system . each time a firm contract is changed for a gas day after the timely cycle is run , this batch job or stored procedure should automaticly rum again for that contract that was changed .
thanks ramona

subject : re - start / integration planning
we have for the last couple of weeks started to compile the re - start / integration plans for netco . so far , we have primarily focussed on the mid / back plans where the technology requirements have been the driving factors . several plans are in the final stages of completion including : -
+ infrastructure jenny rub
+ development jay webb
+ enrononline webb / forster
+ hr david oxley
+ cash management tom myers
+ credit debbie brackett
the rest will be completed shortly .
we now need to focus on the commercial plans which have a slightly different focus . john and i would like to receive the plans "" re - start / integration "" plans by january 7 th , 2002 in order to go through them individually with each of you or in groups . the focus should be to ensure that we have as much of the business up and running in the shortest time possible . i have a suggested outline which you do not have to use but i thought it might help . please decide within yourselves the areas you will cover together or individually .

hello vince ,
i ' m writing to follow up with you regarding our meeting last week . did we
do something wrong in our presentation or in the set up of this presentation ?
for a group of 50 researchers we were expecting a larger crowd and also
some peole perhaps from your it department . also when you left i was
wondering if we had offended you .
the ability to use our products to create open models , integrate databases ,
c , vb , etc . and then quickly deploy them to others has been embraced by
the risk management world . we met the following day with a large group
from ees and they seemed quite enthusiastic about the innovation possible
with our tools .
i realize you are quite busy , but could you please let me know what
happened and how we can prevent this in the future ?
thanks

attn : dear president / md .
with due respect , trust and humility , i use this
medium to write this letter to you irrespective of the fact that you do not know me , but please do consider this letter as a request from a family in dare need of assistance .
let me formally introduce myself . i am duve khumalo , the son of late . dr . robinson khumalo , the renowned zimbabwean wine and cattle ranch farmer .
i got your contact courtesy of a business journal from the south african information exchange in my earnest search for a reliable and trustworthy individual / company who can assist me in this business .
during the war waged against the farmers in zimbabwe by the supporters and cohorts of president robert mugabe to claim all the white owned farms in our country , my late father belonged to one of the classes of farmers targeted by the zanu - pf armed group , because he did not support their ideas and policies .
in the course of the revolution in the country , the zanu - pf armed group attacked and invaded my father ' s farms burning , destroying and eventually killing him . after my father ' s death last year , i managed to escape the boundaries of zimbabwe into south africa with my mother , because our lives were threatened and zimbabwe was no longer safe for us .
we escaped safely into south africa with my father ' s lifetime fortune of us $ 25 ( twenty five million
us dollars ) cash , bonds , important documents of property title and other valuables , which he instructed i his son on before his death . the money and valuables were concealed and secured in two treasure boxes , and were transported to netherlands through diplomatic means .
the boxes are currently safely secured in the vaults of a private security and brokerage firm there in netherlands .
presently , i am residing temporarily with my mother in johannesburg pending the outcome of an appeal filed on my behalf by my attorney for the department of home affairs to grant us political asylum .
at the moment , i am in a dilemma on how to move this money safely out of netherlands for investments . moreover , due to netherlands government ' s stringent monetary policies / regulations and the sensitive and volatile political status of the region , it would be most dangerous to attempt investments there as such act could jeopardize our chances .
in recognition of your personal executive powers and investment opportunities that abound in your country , i solicit for your assistance in moving this money into your bank account for safekeeping pending our future arrival for investments .
my mother and i have resolved to compensate you adequately by offering a brokerage commission of 20 % of the money .
we have also earmarked 5 % for pre - transfer expenses we may incur in the course of the transaction and guarantee that any other expenses during the transaction are subject to refund .
i have in mind to establish a good business and friendly relationship with you in the nearest future if you are able to assist us .
please let me receive your approval or reply through this my email address ( khumaduvel 01 @ netscape . net ) or phone number above and feel free to ask any questions you may consider relevant and kindly , send your phone and fax number for easier communication .
if you are unable to assist please be kind to notify me so that i can look for a suitable alternative .
please accept my warm compliments , as i earnestly wait for your urgent response .
best regard ,
duve khumalo

subject : office space in nyc as per your request
fred ,
ubs has their main trade floor in stamford , ct . they are actually increasing the floor ( size of football field ) by 50 % to move more people into the space ( perhaps some texans ? ! ) . this is probably the most realistic space for us to move to as it is their head office in north america .
there is also an office in midtown manhattan on park at 44 th street .
i asked bob and david hoog ( per ' s right - hand - men ) cost of executive office space in manhattan ( i think by their quick respnse time it is something that grp has also been looking into . )
they said :
midtown 1500 sq ft for 3 / 4 people with a conference rm is approx $ 40 - 60 / sq ft assuming it is wired plus approx $ 20 / sq ft for utilities . and more people now willing to negotiate short term contracts and subleases
the woman most aware of how to arrange satellite offices is paula corey - she was in charge of our moves within ny and i believe she is still with enron in houston .
she would know real estate brokers etc .
i honestly think that the ny situation is different from the mexico office one as we are renting our current space from mg and by the time we may be asked to leave ( end of feb ) , you / we should know more abt the arrangements with ubs and where their vacancy is available for us .
let me know if there is anything more we need to do from this end .
have a good day

efficacy of the curve on a ( minimum ) monthly basis and report all highly
sensitive curves , rac will not approve or disapprove a curve but question
methodology / motivations and subsequent changes and do so in a senior
management forum ( i . e . , we will tell on those who have suspect curves or

following steve ' s note to you earlier today , i wanted to mention that we have
a fairly urgent need for review of the copper curve in particular , as there
is a deal due for final pricing in the next few days .
i am not sure what data you have received from enron metals in london , so i
am asking tim poullain - patterson to ensure that you have the curves and the
economic justification proposed as soon as possible . please direct any
questions to him or to harry tefoglou . i will be in the tokyo office next
week , but available via e - mail .
thanks in advance for your assistance ,

"we would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who took the time to
respond to the pulse survey conducted in october . your feedback is very much
appreciated .
the survey helps identify inhibitors that keep you from accomplishing your
job , while helping us assess the company  , s progress toward removing barriers
that keep employees from achieving their personal best .
out of the 2 , 299 ena / egm / eim employees invited to participate in the survey ,
1 , 478 , or 64 % responded . enron uses an outside firm , watson wyatt , to
tabulate data and report results . a synopsis of what we heard from you has
been added to our intranet site . the site address is
http : / / home . ena . enron . com / pulse / .
our strengths
strengths are based on the highest percentages of favorable responses to
survey questions :
* employees are satisfied with their benefits 87 %
* employees can believe information from top management 78 %
* employees would recommend ena / egm / eim as a good place to work 78 %
* supervisors / managers treat their employees fairly 76 %
* supervisors / managers encourage teamwork 73 %
* people are treated with respect 72 %
* ena / egm / eim is well managed 72 %
improvement opportunities
improvement opportunities are based on the lowest percentages of favorable
responses to survey questions :
* communication / information flow 35 %
* information technology 32 %
* workload 26 %
we are pleased with these results because they exhibit a strong belief in
enron  , s core values of respect , integrity , communication and excellence .
these results are indicative of the quality of our employees at all levels .
the pulse survey enables us to focus on real issues affecting each employee .
we will evaluate these results and consider remedies to the inhibitors that
affect us on a daily basis . your ideas are welcomed and we will be seeking
your input . great strides have been made since the first survey in 1996 , and
we intend to continue in this vein .
please plan to take part in future surveys , which will continue providing
valuable information to help build a successful organization . again , thank
you for your input .",ham

julie :
unfortunately , our reviewer has not come back to us with comments , so i am
sending you the final version without the benefit of review .
the attached zipped file contains the second half of the chapter for which i
was responsible . vince will send you his half separately . putting them
together should be a simple matter of cut and paste , assuming that vince has
not changed his equation , figure , or table numbering .
i presume chris will be reading through the chapter once again for editorial
reasons . there is one place where i would ask him for specific redaction :
table 3 . 6 "" model specifications "" on page 14 / 15 has a column labeled "" equation
reference "" . some cells are blank because the equations specified have not
been referenced previously in the parts i have written . nevertheless , the
concepts are surely introduced elsewhere in the book , and it may be helpful
for chris to insert the appropriate reference in this table . alternatively ,
one could simply delete the column .
if i can help in any way , please do not hesitate to contact me .

"mahonia transaction is one way margin only because mahonia has already prepaid their leg of the transaction so there is never a scenario where the floating leg would be less than the fixed leg ( which has been bought down to 0 ) so margining is not possible in that direction . as prices fall we effectively begin to repay the transaction . we can followup in more detail later on the structure but we will also work on mitigating the margin req due to falling prices as the pipe deal closes and resources can be redeployed .

"hello vince and john ,
i wanted to forward to you both the current presentations for campus . we can
tweak these however we feel appropriate to match cal berkeley on monday . i
believe that we can probably expect about 30 - 50 students ( based on interest
shown at the career fair ) . these tend to be fairly informal . i was thinking
that we could present in this order :
vince gives the enron overview presentation ( 30 minutes )
john gives the global technology specific presentation ( 20 minutes )
ashley goes over recruiting information at the end ( 10 minutes )
please take a look at each presentation and speaker notes to ensure that you
feel comfortable with the layout and content . i am meeting with john today
at 1 : 30 - vince if you would like to get together and discuss as well that
would be great .
if you have any questions , please don ' t hesitate to contact me . 3 - 3589
thanks ,
ashley
vince , here is a copy of the current enron overview presentation . there are

are also speaker notes that go into greater detail . - - - >",ham
"here is the latest trading request :

currently , the tw market team manually calculates the various prices associated with our negotiated rate deals at the end of every month . once the calculation is complete , the price is input into the billing system so customer invoices can be generated . i have 3 - 4 people spending a full day every month end performing this rate calc for their deals ( no two are exactly alike ) .
these calculations are all based on various published market indices . as you evaluate the development and installation of the new contract billing system , is there a way we can automate this rate process ? were it not for the manual labor process , the tw team would likely do more index - based negotitations .
please let me know your thoughts and timing .

thanks for the update . i fully concur with all the rankings .
it seems things are going well with the research group in
london and this is , to a very large extent , your contribution .

that he can run the group in the future . steve emerged as a natural

subject : london research prc
vince ,
we had the prc preranking for rac and research in london yesterday . here ' s
how everyone came out :
steven - superior : no controversy here . steve received consistently strong
feedback ( ranked as either superior or excellent in all categories ) . the
only rough spot was teamwork , arising from the friction between anjam and
himself .
anjam - excellent : anjam received rankings of superiors or excellents in all
categories . several reviewers commented that anjam ' s performance in the
areas of producing results in a timely manner and communication have
improved . i felt the overall ranking of excellent was justified based on
this feedback , even though in terms of leadership i don ' t rate him high
enough to run the group here .
stinsen provided the most insightful comment on anjam ' s performance :
"" technically superior but lets his quest for a leadership position detract
from his overall performance "" .
on a related topic , anjam has been taking random days off , typically on short
notice , so i suspect he ' s interviewing for a new job . given his inability to
work with steven ( especially in the future when stephen heads the group ) ,
this may be the best long - term solution . any thoughts ?
ben - superior : another non - controversial ranking . ben received
consistently high marks from all the groups he supports , especially in the
area of non - technical skills .
i nominated ben for promotion to senior specialist . even though he was
promoted at year end , he ' s taken on a lot of responsibility training kirstee
and helping manage the other quant resources in brian ' s group . also , since
kirstee was hired in at the same level as ben , a mid - year promotion is
appropriate since he ' s effectively her supervisor .
kirstee - strong : only limited feedback in the 2 months she ' s been here .
high marks for technical / quantitative , strong in the "" soft "" skills . i think
the strong rating is the right message for early in the game - gives her a
target for improvement for the rest of the year .

"from : mrs . victoria ndlovu
attn :
you may be surprised to receive this letter from me
since you don ' t know me personally , but for the
introduction , i am mrs . victoria ndlovu , the wife of
late dr . onomua andrew ndlovu who was recently murdered
in the land dispute inzimbabwe .
i got your contact from the international trade
centre here in johhanesburg and decided to write
you . my husband was among the few black zimbabwe rich
famers murdered in the cold blood by the agents of the
ruling governmentof president robert mugabe for his
alleged support and sympathy for the zimbabwean
opposition party , controlled by the white minority .
before his death , he had taken me to to deposite the
sum offive million dollars us $ 5 m . with a security and
finance company as if he knew the looming danger in
zimbabwe . the money was deposited in a box as
gemstones to avoid much demurrage from the security
company .
this money was earmarked for the purchase of new farm
machinery and chemicals for the establishment of our
new farm in lesotho and swaziland . this land problem
arose when president robert mugabe introduced a new
land act , which wholly affected the rich white famers
and some blacks vehemently condemned the
modusoperand "" adopted by the government . this resulted
to rampant killings and mob actions by the war
veterans and some political thugs presently , more than
six - hundred [ 600 ] people have so far been killed . heads
of government from the west , especially the great
britain and the united states of america have voice
their condemnation of mugabe ' s plan .
the south africa development community ( sadec ) has
continuously supported mugabe ' s new land reform act . it
is against this background that i and my children who
are currently staying as refugee in a south african
republic but currently seeking an assylum in any of
the the west african countries have decided to
transfer my late husband ' s money into a foreign
account .
as the only and legitimate - wife of my late husband i
am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a
genuine foreign account where this money could be
transfer without theknowledge of my country ' s
government who are tatically freezing our
familieswealthback home in zimbabwe and the south
africa government seems to be playing along with them .
i am faced with the delimma of investing this amount
of money in the south africa republic for the fear of
encountering the same experience in future since both
countries have almost the same political
history . moreso , the south africa financial foreign
exchange policy does not allow such investment hence i
am seeking for assistance . as a business person whom i
must entrust my future and that of my family on his
hands , i must let you know that this transfer is 100 %
risk free .
therefore if you accept to assist my family , we are
willing to offer you 20 % of the total sum for your
assitance , 70 % for me and my family , while 10 % will be
mapped out for all expenses . i would wish to invest in
your country on real - estate based on your advice and
i would also receive assurance that you would ' nt sit
on this money when transfered into your personal or
company account . if this plea is acceptable by you
please do send me your personaldetails , name and
address , telephone and fax numbers . you should know
that this business is highly confidential and shall be
kept within you alone . i hope to hear from you soon on
the above email address .
thanks ,
best regards ,
mrs victoria ndlovu .

drop in natural - gas prices may be good for consumers but hinder new production
by alexei barrionuevo
staff reporter of the wall street journal
10 / 02 / 2001
the wall street journal
c 7
( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . )
in the wake of last month ' s terrorist attacks , natural - gas prices have slid below $ 2 per million british thermal units , frustrating any hopes that prices will rebound this year to levels that would encourage more investment in natural - gas projects .
analysts predict that with prices at current levels , projects to bring more liquefied natural gas into the u . s . could be shelved or canceled .
natural - gas prices , which reached highs of nearly $ 10 per million btus last december , had held to around $ 3 to $ 5 per million btus for much of the year . at $ 2 per million btus and below , producers have a hard time justifying exploration and new production .
analysts blamed the drop on weak industrial demand , fueled by the struggling chemicals and metals industries and by weaker electric - utility demand . nearby november futures fell 36 cents yesterday to $ 2 . 208 on the new york mercantile exchange .
in the boston area , however , different concerns could lead to higher prices for that region . last week , the u . s . coast guard , under pressure from local lawmakers , indefinitely banned lng tankers from entering boston harbor . lng makes up 15 % of new england ' s gas supply and nearly half of its supply on very cold days . the coast guard and department of transportation are studying concerns that a lng tanker could become a bomb for terrorists .
already , relative to other areas , natural - gas prices have inched higher in new england , where natural - gas pipeline constraints have long hampered the market . the spread between prices in new england and the gulf coast widened last week by 30 cents to $ 1 . 30 per million btus , said a spokeswoman for distrigas , a unit of belgium ' s tractebel sa . but the lack of lng isn ' t likely to become a big issue until winter hits and natural - gas storage is used up .
richard grant , ceo of distrigas , says lng has a 30 - year safety record at the company ' s everett , mass . , terminal . while lng is flammable , he says it is unlikely to explode . he adds that "" there are a lot of things being said right now that are just not factual . but until we answer the concerns , we won ' t be able to bring a ship in here . ""
deutsche banc alex . brown was among several brokerage firms downgrading fourth - quarter projections for natural - gas prices last week . "" prior to sept . 11 , we were seeing signs that a lot of industrial demand was coming back , "" said jay saunders , a deutsche banc analyst . "" but all that is out the window now . "" deutsche banc is now estimating a 20 % drop in winter demand in the industrial sector , which accounts for more than a quarter of total u . s . natural - gas consumption . the slack demand has resulted in supplies that have practically overflowed storage , which is on pace to be full by the end of october .
while prices that are close to historical levels are good for consumers , such low prices could scare many producers away from making investments to ensure future natural - gas demand is met . lower prices have already led energy companies to slow their drilling and some firms , such as eog resources inc . , plan to moderate production in the next two months . gas drilling - rig counts fell to 953 last week from 1 , 030 at the end of august .
even with the increased natural - gas drilling of earlier this year , overall natural - gas supply is expected to increase just 1 % this year , as the country ' s mature wells continue to be depleted faster than companies can replace them . the tight supply picture has analysts optimistic that prices will rebound next year amid lower interest rates , increased defense and relief spending and returning consumer confidence .
still , the downturn could cause some firms to rethink or postpone projects to import gas in a liquid form . with prices high last winter , el paso corp . and enron corp . , among others , said they would build a dozen or so receiving terminals for liquefied natural gas , which is gas compressed and frozen to minus - 260 degrees fahrenheit . "" you will see some cancellations and some delays , "" predicts marshall adkins , an analyst with raymond james & associates in houston .
natural - gas prices need to average $ 3 per million btus on the east coast and $ 3 . 50 on the west coast to justify bringing in lng to those areas , said ronald barone , an analyst with ubs warburg .
a spokeswoman for el paso , houston , says the company is moving forward with at least three terminals for the u . s . market . enron said it is also pushing ahead with a terminal in the bahamas that would pipe the gas to florida starting in 2004 .

enron leases part of mumbai estate to citibank

copyright ( c ) business standard
after months of scouting for a buyer for its one lakh square feet office space at wockhardt towers in bandra - kurla complex , enron has been able lease out 10 , 000 square feet of it to citibank na .
against an expected realisation from rs 130 crore for the outright sale of its four floors , enron will get around rs 1 . 2 crore a year by leasing out one floor to citibank .
the deal was struck recently by the global real estate consultant , cushman & wakefield , at a monthly rental of rs 100 per square foot .
with property prices in mumbai having slumped and with no reprieve expected in the
short run , companies are increasingly opting to lease space instead of blocking funds in illiquid assets .
property consultants say that if enron manages to lease out the entire four floors , it will be easier for it to sell the property to a buyer , as the buyer would be assured of a fixed income .
enron had eyed a deal of rs 130 crore when it mandated global real estate consultants to sell the premises at around rs 12 , 000 per square foot .
this is despite the fact that real estate at bandra kurla currently fetches rs 8 , 000 to rs 9 , 000 per square feet . in june 2000 , the us energy giant had shelled out rs 125 . 75 crore when it acquired the four floors , plus car park space , from wockhardt , the pharmaceutical company .
the deal was struck at rs 10 , 500 per sq ft , and included parking space for 101 cars .
industry sources said that enron had spent a sum close to rs 150 crore to acquire the property , and pay for the interior furnishings of two of the four floors it had acquired .
in order for it to break even , it would have had to sell its real estate at the rate of rs 13 , 000 per square foot .
four to five global real estate consultants have been appointed by enron for the sale of its premises . a leading consultant said that it has been difficult to find any buyers for such a large property .
"" most international buyers prefer to take property on lease instead of an outright purchase , "" he added .
moreover , the inefficiency of the building in terms of the super built - up area is another reason why corporate entities are not too eager to acquire the premises , and enron ' s proposition continues to go abegging , said the consultant .

though hewlett - packard lost $ 65 billion in market value in a year , ceo carly fiorina hasn ' t lost her nerve , and for the fourth consecutive year holds the no . 1 position on fortune ' s ranking of the 50 most powerful women in business .
the complete list and accompanying stories are in the october 15 issue of fortune , available on newsstands october 8 and at www . fortune . com at 12 : 00 p . m . on october 1 .
in the no . 2 spot is ebay ceo meg whitman , who runs an internet company that actually makes money : $ 85 million in the last four quarters on $ 582 million in revenue . oprah winfrey , the queen of media , is mightier than ever , and holds the no . 3 spot , up from no . 15 last year . she produces movies , brings comfort and advice to millions of tv viewers , propels books to bestsellerdom , and , last year , teamed up with hearst magazines ' cathie black ( no . 28 on the list ) to publish o , the oprah magazine - by some measures the most successful magazine startup ever . at no . 4 is andrea jung , chairman and ceo of avon , who has breathed life into ailing avon . mirant ceo marce fuller - the only newcomer in the top five - holds the no . 5 position . inside a stodgy utility , southern , fuller built a high - growth trading and marketing unit , which was spun off in april .
in these new , more tempered times , patience may be about to reap its reward . in fortune ' s annual survey of the 50 most powerful women in business , there is a clear emergence of women who came to power slowly . says fortune senior writer pattie sellers in "" patient but not passive , "" the story that accompanies the list , "" by patience , we mean staying with a company , steadily building influence there , and rising to power through determination and insider knowledge , not promises and self - promotion . ""
fiorina , who has claimed the top spot each year since fortune ' s inaugural list in 1998 , heads the biggest company ( $ 48 billion in revenues last year ) run by a woman . and she is still as audacious and impatient as ever . wall street practically heckled her latest move - a bold bet to buy compaq - but fiorina , 47 , remains defiant . in difficult times , "" people who drive change are the subject of great scrutiny , "" she says .
as always , the list is a snapshot of power at a moment in time . last year , power resided in the technology and internet sectors , but that influence was fleeting . gone from the list this year : deborah "" hurricane debby "" hopkins , who pushed her agenda too ambitiously at lucent and lost her cfo job in may ; ellen hancock , who failed at the startup , exodus ; and morgan stanley ' s mary meeker , who influenced so many to buy into the internet fizz . but one web warrior looks better than ever : meg whitman , no . 2 on the list . she has never overpromised to investors ; instead she has diligently delivered above - target profits every single quarter .
fourteen newcomers join the list this year : marce fuller , president louise kitchen , coo , enron americas ; colleen barrett , president betsy bernard , president & ceo , at anne stevens , vp , north america vehicle operations , ford motor ; maria elena lagomasino , chairman susan desmond - hellman , evp and chief medical officer , genentech ; janet robinson , svp , newspaper operations , new york times co . ; carol tomi , evp and cfo , home depot ; carrie cox , evp and president , global prescriptions , pharmacia ; carole black , president and ceo , lifetime television networks ; janet davidson , group president , integrated network solutions , lucent ; larree renda , evp , retail operations , safeway ; and louise francesconi , vp and gm , missile systems , raytheon .
while the economy and its points of power change , the criteria we use to evaluate power remains the same . says sellers : "" we consider the size and importance of a woman ' s business in the global economy , her clout inside her company , and the arc of her career - where she has been and where she is likely to go . when appropriate , we also weigh the woman ' s influence on mass culture and society . that factor lifts oprah winfrey to no . 3 on this year ' s list . "" the shifts on our list this year are dramatic , with 14 newcomers . but one trend is especially intriguing : women are taking on bigger businesses than ever . a few years ago , responsibility for a $ 3 billion business almost automatically earned a woman a spot on this list . no more . this year ' s fortune 50 includes several women who lead businesses with annual revenues of $ 20 billion or more , which is a first .
in a related story , "" it took a lady to save avon , "" katrina brooker looks at andrea jung , chairman and ceo of avon . says brooker , "" jung knows what women want and how to sell it to them . and that ' s what has made her one of the most successful ceos - male or female - in recent years . "" over the past 20 months she has overhauled nearly everything about the way avon does business : how it advertises , manufactures , packages , and even sells its products , and she has done it not by abandoning the seemingly outdated avon lady , but by reviving her . the result : growth in revenues , operating profits , and operating margins .
in addition , fortune includes an international list of the 50 powerful women in business . the top ten , featured in the magazine , are marjorie scardino , ceo , pearson ( britain ) ; anne lauvergeon , chairman , areva ( france ) ; mary ma , senior vp marianne nivert , president lien siaou - sze , vice president , hewlett - packard ( hong kong ) ; patricia barbizet , ceo , artemis ( france ) ; eiko kono , president , recruit ( japan ) : belinda stronach , ceo , magna international ( canada ) ; marina berlusconi , vice chairman , fininvest ( italy ) ; christine tsung , president & ceo , china airlines ( taiwan ) . you can read about the other forty at www . fortune . com or in the international editions of fortune .

( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . )
enron corp . warned that continuing credit worries , a decline in the value of some of its assets and reduced trading activity could hurt its fourth - quarter earnings .
the energy company said it may be forced to take a $ 700 million pretax hit to earnings due to a plunge in the value of assets held by one of its investment partnerships . the partnership , whitewing llp , held assets with a book value of $ 4 . 7 billion on nov . 16 but a drop in the value of enron stock held by the partnership could result in a derivative loss of $ 700 million , the company said .
in addition , enron , houston , said it may have to come up with more money to honor a collateral call on a $ 690 million note . that note became a "" demand obligation , "" on nov . 12 , when enron ' s credit rating got lowered to triple - b - minus by standard & poor ' s . the company didn ' t disclose who holds the note .
"" we ' ve got nine days to either repay the note or post a letter of credit or they can start liquidating assets , "" said company spokesman mark palmer . one of the assets includes c . e . g . rio , a gas distribution company in brazil that enron already is in the process of selling and whose proceeds it had intended to use for other forms of debt reduction . the company said it is trying to negotiate a waiver or extension of the credit provision with lenders to preserve its cash .
enron has set up a number of partnerships over the years to hedge investment risks and , in some cases , to keep debt off its balance sheet . in the wake of a securities and exchange commission formal probe into its accounting and disclosure practices launched oct . 31 , the company restated its earnings downward dating back to 1997 and has consolidated some debt back onto its balance sheet .
the company on nov . 9 agreed to merge with competitor dynegy inc . but its latest sec filing said it was sued by shareholders on nov . 12 in state court in houston to prevent the merger from happening . the petition alleges that enron ' s directors breached their fiduciary duties to enron ' s shareholders by agreeing to sell enron for inadequate consideration and without an adequate investigation of the alternatives available to enron . enron said it would vigorously defend itself .
yesterday ' s filing included numerous changes in previously reported numbers for revenues and expenses . in its original third - quarter statement , the company reported a loss of $ 618 million . the stated loss was increased to $ 635 million last week and in the latest filing , the loss for the quarter ended sept . 30 was widened to $ 664 million .
enron added that the numbers contained in latest filing aren ' t necessarily final because its external auditor , arthur andersen , hasn ' t completed its review , nor has an internal audit committee finished reviewing the firm ' s accounting practices .

senior wall street bankers are concerned that dynegy could walk away from its proposed $ 9 . 8 bn ( # 6 . 8 bn ) rescue bid for its rival energy group enron - a move that would have severe repercussions for the energy trading sector and financial markets .
in a series of interviews with the financial times , bankers expressed worries that while credit rating agencies had been assured that it was extremely difficult for dynegy to pull out , some of the company ' s shareholders were under the impression that the "" material adverse change "" clause could be triggered .
"" there is no way you can say that this deal is definitely going to happen , or even likely to happen , "" one banker said . "" and the knock on effects of it not going ahead are not good , "" he added . none of the bankers would agree to be publicly identified .
the possibility of dynegy dropping out of the deal was discussed when senior bankers from jp morgan chase and citigroup , which are advising enron , met with officials from moody ' s , the credit rating agencies , 10 days ago .
the rating agency expressed concerns that it would be too easy for dynegy to give up its bid , further undermining enron ' s creditworthiness .
moody ' s decision to preserve enron ' s investment grade rating was one of the main reasons why dynegy was able to go ahead with its rescue bid .
in justifying the all - stock bid , chuck watson , chairman of dynegy , said last week that buying the company for a low price - a fraction of enron ' s market capitalisation at its peak in 2000 - was a major protection against failure .
but he admitted that much of the last round of negotiations with moody ' s had been spent reassuring them that the material adverse change clauses in the merger agreement were not too loose .
according to dynegy , the material adverse change clauses relate to the outcome of a securities and exchange commission inquiry into enron ' s finances , possible litigation against the energy company , balance sheet strength and earnings forecasts . www . ft . com / enron .

enron drops earnings for 3 rd quarter
$ 690 million debt comes due for downgraded firm
by tom fowler
copyright 2001 houston chronicle
enron corp . ' s financial well - being continues to be a moving target as the company made more adjustments to its earnings monday .
in a securities and exchange commission filing , enron said it reduced third - quarter earnings by 3 cents per share and increased earnings for the first nine months of 2001 by 1 cent to reflect recently discovered accounting errors .
the company also said that its recent credit rating drop may force it to pay off a $ 690 million note by nov . 27 if it doesn ' t find collateral to guarantee the debt .
the revelations came in the embattled energy trader ' s 10 - q document , which companies must file every quarter with details of their earnings and balance sheet . enron delayed releasing the 10 - q by five days and said the filing made monday had not been fully audited by its accounting firm , andersen , because of an ongoing investigation by the company ' s board of directors and the need for more time .
"" we are continuing to review the transactions in question and are making progress with our investigation , "" said william k . powers jr . , chairman of enron ' s special investigation committee and dean of the university of texas school of law .
enron ' s pending $ 690 million iou is related to a limited partnership to buy natural gas assets in brazil . one of the terms of the partnership requires enron to repay the debt if its credit rating slips to bbb - on rating agency standard & poor ' s scale , which it did nov . 12 . if enron doesn ' t put up collateral equal to the amount of the note or repay it , the other partners in the deal can sell off the partnership ' s assets .
enron officials said in the filing they are working with lenders to come up with an acceptable agreement on the debt .
if enron ' s debt rating continues to drop , which would put it below investment grade , the company would face another $ 3 . 9 billion in debt repayments , the company said in the filing , mainly by two other partnerships formed in recent years : $ 2 . 4 billion owed by osprey trust and $ 915 million by marlin water trust .
enron is under a negative review by most rating agencies , but a cash infusion from dynegy combined with additional lines of credit from a number of investment banks and a possible $ 500 million to $ 1 billion equity investment by other investors is expected to keep the ratings afloat .
the turmoil around enron ' s finances started after oct . 16 , when steep losses in its third - quarter earnings drew renewed attention to a pair of investment partnerships created by the former chief financial officer with the approval of the company ' s board of directors .
the ljm partnerships were formed using enron equity and outside capital as a way to hedge against the risks involved in some of the company ' s new lines of business and were designed to help the company grow quickly without adding too much debt to its books or diluting the value of the company ' s stock .
the cfo ' s dual roles as a company executive and managing director of the entities prompted an sec investigation as well as an internal enron investigation that led the company to cut its earnings over the past 4 1 / 2 years by nearly $ 600 million .
those problems shook investor and trading partner confidence in enron , which led to a sharp drop in its stock price and cuts in its credit rating . the company eventually reached a deal with rival dynegy to be acquired for almost $ 9 billion in stock plus the assumption of almost $ 13 billion in debt and $ 2 billion in preferred stock .
the fallout from enron ' s crumble is spreading to its major service providers , including andersen . that firm has been named as a defendant in at least one shareholder lawsuit , while on monday rep . john dingell , d - mich . , called for an investigation of andersen in connection with its audits of enron and houston - based waste management .
"" the best accounting standards in the world are meaningless if the accounting and audit processes are so inept or corrupt that they produce unreliable numbers and untruthful reporting , "" dingell wrote in a letter to the public oversight board requesting the investigation .
andersen , based in chicago , has a large houston office and a strong foothold in the energy industry with clients , including enron and dynegy . critics of andersen have said the firm should have done more as enron ' s auditor to draw investors ' attention to the company ' s unusual finances .
a lawsuit filed in oregon alleged andersen ' s judgment was swayed by lucrative consulting fees that it received from enron while it was auditor .
in june , andersen was fined $ 7 million by the sec to settle charges that it filed false and misleading audit reports of waste management , the largest civil penalty against a big five accounting firm . andersen did not admit or deny the charges .

enron corp . warned in a regulatory filing that it could be forced to pay a $ 690 - million debt by next week and reduced its already abysmal third - quarter earnings .
the energy giant said a downgrading of its debt last week triggered a monday deadline for it to repay or offer collateral against the $ 690 million owed to a party in one of its partnerships .
if the debt isn ' t paid , the partner could liquidate the partnership ' s assets , which include a brazilian natural gas company that enron was counting on selling to raise $ 250 million in cash .
enron has already used up its $ 3 - billion credit line , secured roughly $ 2 billion in loans and is looking for more cash .
the company reduced its previously reported results for the third quarter by 3 cents a share , according to its filing with the securities and exchange commission . that would put its loss at 87 cents a share .

a congressman has called for an investigation of big five accounting firm arthur andersen in connection with its audits of enron corp . and waste management inc . , according to a letter released monday .
turning up the heat under the conflict - of - interest issue among the world ' s largest bean - counters , rep . john d . dingell ( d - mich . ) asked the public oversight board for a "" review or special investigation of arthur andersen llp , "" said the letter .
dingell also asked the board to look into peer reviews of arthur andersen conducted in recent years by other accounting firms , including deloitte & touche , and questioned the value of a triennial peer review process in place since 1978 .
arthur andersen , based in chicago , was auditor to houston energy trading giant enron , rocked in recent weeks by a securities and exchange commission probe of outside partnership deals involving company officers . enron ' s stock price has plunged , several managers have resigned and numerous shareholder lawsuits are pending .

u . s . official calls for probe of andersen , 2 problem audits

washington - - concerned about the accounting profession ' s ability to police itself , a senior house of representatives democrat has called for a "" special investigation "" of arthur andersen llp and its audits of enron corp . and waste management inc .
in a letter to u . s . public oversight board chairman charles bowsher released monday , rep . john dingell , a michigan democrat , requested a review of andersen ' s audits of enron and waste management , two high - profile audit failures .
enron , of houston , which recently agreed to be acquired by crosstown rival dynergy inc . , acknowledged it overstated net income by $ 586 million ( 662 . 5 million euros ) and will need to restate financial reports dating back to 1997 .
the u . s . securities and exchange commission is investigating enron ' s treatment of investments in limited partnerships tied to former chief financial officer andrew fastow .
enron ' s problems come on the heels of another audit debacle for andersen . in june , the firm reached a $ 7 million settlement with the sec in which it neither admitted nor denied allegations of fraud in its audit of waste management .
andersen and the waste hauler paid $ 220 million in 1999 to settle class - action lawsuits alleging massive accounting fraud that inflated waste management ' s reported earnings in the mid - 1990 s .
in addition to the sec ' s probe of its role in the enron matter , andersen is undergoing routine peer review by deloitte & touche . dingell suggested that review may be clouded by the fact that deloitte & touche has been hired by outside lawyers representing a special committee of enron ' s board of directors .
given the potential conflict of interest on the part of deloitte & touche , and andersen ' s track record , "" there appears to be little reason for the public to have faith in andersen or the peer review process , "" mr . dingell wrote .

passing up
some senior executives are spurning hefty severance packages .
last week , enron corp . chairman kenneth lay decided to forgo a $ 60 . 6 million severance payment that would have been triggered by dynegy inc . ' s planned acquisition of the houston energy trader . enron initially said mr . lay would keep one - third of the planned payout and take it in shares of the combined company . he later decided against any severance payment after criticism by influential energy traders , who produce most of enron ' s profits .
"" in this environment , we ' re seeing producers putting pressure on managers and managers putting pressure on producers to ensure that their pay is in line with their performance , "" says ira kay , executive - compensation practice leader of pay - and - benefits consultants watson wyatt worldwide in new york .
alan johnson , managing director of new york pay consultants johnson associates , says mr . lay ' s initial intention to accept a portion of his severance represents "" the continuing trend of executives being clueless . ""
( for the 12 months ended aug . 31 , mr . lay received about $ 70 million from exercising enron stock options , according to disclosure reports tracked by thomson financial . )
three top executives of us airways group inc . , including chief executive rakesh gangwal and chairman stephen wolf , passed up severance after deciding to stay at the company when a planned merger fell through . the trio stood to gain $ 45 million for resigning as a result of severance agreements triggered by shareholder approval of its now - defunct merger accord with ual corp . at us airways ' sept . 19 annual meeting , they said they would remain with the company .
firm relationship
new york law firm cadwalader , wickersham & taft last week rolled out an unusual formal mentoring program for first - year associates .
for two hours a month for at least a year , each associate will meet with a designated mentor - - typically a midlevel associate - - to discuss issues such as career development . if the relationship doesn ' t click , new pairings will be made . cwt hires about 50 law - school graduates a year .
jordan schwartz , the firm ' s hiring partner , says the initiative was sparked by a 2000 survey of midlevel associates at 165 u . s . law firms conducted by american lawyer magazine . the poll , which assesses how associates perceive they are being treated , ranked the firm last . "" it wasn ' t an accurate reflection of the firm , "" he says . "" but it was a wake - up call . ""
so , cwt created an "" associate task force "" that identified key issues and explored ways to improve the quality of work life . the mentoring program was one result .
hiring blitz
despite rising joblessness , a few employers are hiring in a big way .
ziprealty inc . , an online real - estate broker in richmond , calif . , recently announced plans to hire 1 , 000 real - estate agents within the next 18 months . it has about 135 agents , all of whom work from home .
"" we have large consumer demands right now , so we want to make sure we have great realtors , "" says scott kucirek , executive vice president of people and culture .
since august , ziprealty has hired nearly 30 agents a month for all its 12 markets , which include los angeles , phoenix , san diego and chicago . the company has three full - time recruiters sending e - mails and making calls to market its recruitment effort . its database contains 200 to 300 prospects .
the job , which usually pays only commission , offers some perks . the company will pay new agents $ 1 , 500 a month for three months to give them time to make connections and sell a home . after that , pay will be entirely commission based . new hires also receive cellphone and car allowances .

in new filing , enron reports debt squeeze
by richard a . oppel jr . and floyd norris

the new york times
page 1 , column 2
c . 2001 new york times company
the enron corporation told investors yesterday that it faced debt repayments over the next year vastly in excess of its available cash . it said that if any of a number of things went wrong , its ability to continue as a going concern would be called into question .
in a delayed quarterly filing with the securities and exchange commission , the company said that it would have to repay $ 690 million in debt by next tuesday if it did not come up with collateral for a loan .
enron has about $ 1 . 75 billion in cash and credit lines now available but faces debt repayments and other obligations of $ 9 . 15 billion by the end of next year . the report for the third quarter , which was filed five days late , says the company faces immediate demand for $ 3 . 9 billion in debts if its credit rating is downgraded any further .
enron ' s independent auditors with the firm of arthur andersen have not been able to complete their review of enron ' s financial statements for the third quarter . andersen already faces lawsuits over its audits of enron ' s books related to enron ' s disclosure this month that it had overstated almost $ 600 million in profits in the last five years . enron has said that it will restate statements that andersen certified and that those statements should no longer be relied upon .
yesterday , representative john d . dingell of michigan , the ranking democrat on the house energy and commerce committee , called for an investigation into arthur andersen ' s handling of the enron audits . a spokesman for andersen could not be reached last night .
enron , the nation ' s largest energy trader , has agreed to be acquired by dynegy inc . , its smaller crosstown rival in houston , and credit rating agencies have said that a failure of that deal to go through would lead to a further downgrading of enron , which is now at the lowest investment - grade rating . any downgrades could lead to a collapse of enron ' s core energy trading business , analysts say , as other energy trading companies might stop doing business with enron entirely .
the dynegy deal is expected to close sometime next year , and the disclosures yesterday indicate that enron may face challenges in meeting its obligations before then , particularly if the closing of the deal is delayed . enron said it hoped to complete the transaction by the end of next september .
enron is in talks to obtain $ 500 million to $ 1 billion in additional financing through an equity infusion from major banks and institutions . in addition , executives have said they are hoping to close deals to sell $ 800 million in assets by the end of the year , and perhaps a few billion dollars of assets next year . enron is also set to receive a $ 1 billion infusion from chevrontexaco , which owns a 27 percent stake in dynegy , if the deal closes next year .
still , even after factoring in cash flow from enron ' s core energy - trading operations , enron could be left well short of what it needs to satisfy the huge obligations due by the end of next year - - meaning that enron will probably have to work to persuade bankers to restructure debts or extend maturities .
carol coale , an analyst for prudential securities in houston , said the new disclosures indicated that enron ' s troubles had run deeper than what investors and analysts believed , even as the stock crashed early this month before the merger with dynegy was announced .
' ' our initial read was that this might have been like a run on the bank , ' ' ms . coale said . ' ' but now it sounds like enron ' s problems were actually more inherent than perceived . ' '
enron ' s deal with dynegy calls for enron holders to receive 0 . 2685 dynegy share for each enron share , but in trading since the deal was announced enron ' s share price has lagged dynegy ' s price , reflecting investor doubts that the deal will be completed at the announced terms .
in new york stock exchange trading yesterday , before the enron filing was released , enron rose 6 cents , to $ 9 . 06 , and dynegy rose $ 1 . 13 , to $ 43 . 60 . at those prices , the value of the dynegy offer is 29 . 2 percent above enron ' s share price , compared with a 20 . 6 percent difference when the deal was announced .
some debts that enron might have to pay quickly if its bond rating is lowered could be satisfied by selling shares , but such sales would probably reduce the stock price further . and the merger agreement with dynegy provides that the exchange ratio would be reduced if enron sold stock at prices below the implied value under the merger - - currently $ 11 . 71 an enron share .
in after - hours trading yesterday , after the release of the enron filing , the share price slipped to $ 9 .
enron had previously said it was reducing its profits taken in previous years by more than $ 500 million . yesterday ' s filing provided some additional details on enron ' s relationships with various related partnerships whose debts enron could be forced to pay , and it said that additional write - offs could come as early as the current quarter if it concluded that asset values in the partnerships had declined . it said that because enron ' s stock value had fallen , one write - down could be $ 700 million .
the disclosures show that enron erected complicated financial structures that in some cases seem to have been meant to allow the company to avoid taking losses on assets and in other cases were aimed at keeping debts off its balance sheet .
but the collapse of enron ' s stock price has both worsened the situation for some of those entities and greatly increased the cost enron would face if it needed to pay off the debts .
' ' it is not possible to predict , ' ' enron warned investors , whether its asset sales or debt refinancings would be successful . ' ' an adverse outcome with respect to any of these matters would likely have a material adverse impact on enron ' s ability to continue as a going concern . ' '

decision to locate conocophillips in houston enhances world ' s energy capital

houston ( ap ) - the decision to base the oil giant created by the combination of phillips petroleum co . and conoco inc . in houston , home of the smaller conoco , helps cement the city ' s status as the nation ' s energy capital .
"" houston already was the energy capital of the world . this just proves it , "" said mark baxter , director of the maguire energy institute at southern methodist university in dallas .
"" all the major players are in houston and houston can accommodate the employee growth base , "" he said . "" it is easier to conduct the business in the houston market because not only are all the major companies there , all the support is in houston as well . ""
the dlrs 15 . 6 billion deal announced sunday that would create the nation ' s third largest oil producer may mean more prestige for houston , even though the nation ' s two largest oil companies - irving - based exxonmobil and san francisco - based chevrontexaco - have their headquarters located elsewhere , each has thousands of employees working in the nation ' s fourth - largest city .
it all began with the 1901 spindletop strike in southeast texas when oilmen discovered that much of the continental united states ' vast oil resources lay beneath texas soil .
"" historically oil and gas centers sprang up adjacent to oil and gas discoveries , "" said david bole , the vice president of randall & dewey , inc . , a houston - based oil consulting firm . "" but certainly with high - speed communications developed over the last 30 years , the decision making has been centralized more in the financial centers .
"" what has set houston apart from many other emerging oil centers was the caliber of the early wildcatters , their vision and their ability to build mega - companies . in many cases it is their legacy that has built houston into today ' s oil capital . ""
shell oil co . is based in houston alongside several other producers and numerous offshore drilling , oil field services , pipeline , oil field firefighting and related companies .
in recent years , the city also has become home to large energy trading firms such as dynegy , inc . , enron corp . , reliant inc . and others . together , they operate dozens of computerized energy trading floors scattered throughout the city .
"" consolidation is cumulative - a self - fulfilling process of centralizing all the important pieces of the oil industry in one place , "" bill gilmer , an economist in houston for the federal reserve bank of dallas , wrote in a recent publication . "" the same principles , of course , are what draw moviemakers to hollywood , financial service providers to new york and automakers to detroit . ""
and , it seems , energy companies to houston .

companies & finance the americas - energy deal savings set to increase .

( c ) 2001 financial times limited . all rights reserved
chevrontexaco yesterday increased the annual savings it expected to achieve from the merger between the two oil groups to $ 1 . 8 bn by march 2003 .
david o ' reilly , chief executive , told analysts that the combined company would also meet its original synergy target of $ 1 . 2 bn within six to nine months of the deal , which was completed last month .
mr o ' reilly also said it expected oil and gas production to grow at an annual rate of 2 . 5 to 3 per cent over the next five years , and dismissed worries about the falling oil price .
"" our business is used to swings and volatility - if you want a stable price environment you don ' t want to be in this business , "" he told reporters after addressing analysts in new york .
mr o ' reilly said the news of the latest big merger in the industry - the $ 35 bn deal between conoco and phillips petroleum - only made him more confident that the chevrontexaco deal was right .
chevrontexaco now claims to be the third - largest energy company in terms of global oil reserves and the fourth - largest in global oil and natural gas production . he said the synergies translated into gains of about $ 1 per share after tax .
chevrontexaco has an important role in dynegy ' s rescue bid for enron , the rival energy group . chevrontexaco has a 26 per cent stake in dynegy and immediately invested $ 1 . 5 bn in convertible preferred shares of dynegy to fund its direct equity infusion in enron . chevrontexaco is committed to buying a further $ 1 bn of dynegy common stock once dynegy completes its takeover . if the deal fails , chevrontexaco can redeem the convertible preferred shares for $ 1 . 5 bn in cash or convert to common shares , giving it a 36 per cent stake in equity .
mr o ' reilly said yesterday the group was committed to the deal , despite worries about potential hidden liabilities at enron .
chevrontexaco is doing its own review of potential litigation risks at enron , and mr o ' reilly said there was "" a full suite of due diligence "" that needed to be done on other issues at enron .
* enron ' s lenders welcomed the energy company ' s openness yesterday following a meeting in new york . greg whalley , enron ' s president , led the meeting , which was postponed when dynegy began talks with enron two weeks ago .
"" much of senior management was there and they were doing a good job , "" said one . another banker said enron management had been "" pretty upfront "" about the problems at the company , although he said most lenders were reluctant to air their concerns in full at the crowded meeting .

houston ( ap ) _ as embattled enron corp . examines its books , the energy trader restated its third - quarter results monday , increasing its loss for the period by three cents a share to 87 cents .
the company also disclosed it is trying to restructure a $ 690 - million obligation that could come due nov . 27 .
enron spokesman mark palmer said the company has the cash on hand to pay the obligation but would like to have it restructured and extended .
` ` we are working with the lenders to restructure or extend the term on the obligation , ' ' he said .
palmer said that when enron ' s credit rating was reduced it triggered a clause in one of the ` ` limited partnership agreements that could cause that $ 690 million obligation to become due beginning next week . ' '
houston - based enron , being purchased by rival dynegy inc . to escape a spate of problems and shattered wall street confidence , also increased nine - month earnings by a penny to 20 cents a share .
dynegy is purchasing the company for $ 7 . 8 billion in stock .
in an sec filing nov . 8 , enron said financial statements from 1997 through the first half of 2001 ` ` should not be relied upon ' ' and that outside businesses run by enron officials during that period should have been included in the company ' s earnings reports .
that would have reduced enron ' s profits for those years by $ 586 million , from $ 2 . 89 billion to $ 2 . 31 billion .
in addition , the company revised its debt upward in each year from 1997 to 2000 ; at the end of 2000 , enron ' s debt was $ 10 . 86 billion , or $ 628 million more than previously reported .
by not disclosing the debt earlier , enron presumably maintained a stronger credit rating and was able to vastly increase the size of its core operations _ trading natural gas and electricity on wholesale markets .
in a filing with the securities and exchange commission on monday , enron explained that auditor arthur andersen llp hasn ' t finalized its review of the company ' s financial statements because of an ongoing investigation by a special committee appointed by enron ' s board of directors .
in the filing , enron reiterated it is developing a plan to exit $ 8 billion in non - core businesses that are performing ` ` below acceptable rates , ' ' and expects to use the proceeds to repay debt .
copyright ? 2000 dow jones at the end of 2000 , enron ' s debt was dlrs 10 . 86 billion , dlrs 628 million more than previously reported .
by not disclosing the debt earlier , enron presumbably maintained a stronger credit rating and was able to vastly increase the size of its core operations - trading natural gas and electricity on wholesale markets .
in a filing with the securities and exchange commission on monday , enron explained that auditor arthur andersen llp hasn ' t finalized its review of the company ' s financial statements because of an ongoing investigation by a special committee appointed by enron ' s board of directors .
"" we are continuing to review the transactions in question and are making progress with our investigation , "" said william k . powers jr . , chairman of the special committee and dean of the university of texas school of law .
the merger is expected to go through by next summer . dynegy , backed by major investor chevrontexaco inc . , will also assume dlrs 13 billion of enron debt .
enron agreed to be bought after its stock price plunged about 80 percent in the weeks after it disclosed a third quarter loss followed by an acknowledgment that the securities and exchange commission was investigating partnerships run by company officials .
the partnerships led to a dlrs 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity and allowed enron to keep about half a billion dollars in debt off its books .
credit services also have diminished enron ' s long - term debt to just above junk grade .
in the filing , enron also reiterated it is developing a plan to exit dlrs 8 billion in non - core businesses that are performing "" below acceptable rates , "" and should be able to use the proceeds to repay debt .
shares of enron were up 6 cents to dlrs 9 . 06 in trading monday on the new york stock exchange . enron announced its latest filing after the market close .

usa : enron sounds debt alarm , reduces reported earnings .
by c . bryson hull

reuters english news service
( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
houston , nov 19 ( reuters ) - humbled energy giant enron corp . on monday warned that it could be forced to pay a $ 690 million debt by next week and reduced its already - abysmal third - quarter earnings .
the houston company sounded the debt and credit alarms once again in a filing made on monday with u . s . securities and exchange commission .
among the new information included is the disclosure that enron is up against a short deadline to meet a $ 690 million debt obligation triggered by a credit downgrade last week . that marked the start of a nine - day period that expires on nov . 26 , during which enron must lay down collateral against the debt owed to a third party in one of its myriad partnerships .
if not , the partner has the right to liquidate all of the assets of the partnership , which includes a brazilian natural gas company that enron was counting on selling to raise $ 250 million in cash .
the company is working to make alternative payment arrangements , since it can ill - afford to pay the debt now . enron has already already maxed out its $ 3 billion credit line , secured roughly $ 2 billion in loans and is looking for more cash to stay afloat .
enron also reduced previously reported 2001 third - quarter earnings by 3 cents per share and increased previously reported earnings for the first 9 months of the year by a penny per share . the move reflects adjustments made after the quarter ' s end , enron said .
on oct . 16 , enron reported a loss of $ 638 million or 84 cents per share for the third quarter of 2001 . on nov 8 , enron said it had restated earnings for 1997 - 2000 and that net income for the four - year period was more than a half a billion lower than originally reported .
it also warned that a further drop in its credit rating could force it to pay $ 3 . 9 billion to other partnerships , the bulk of it to osprey trust and marlin water trust .
such an outcome would keep enron from paying its revolving credit accounts and "" would likely have a material adverse impact on enron ' s ability to continue as a going concern , "" the company wrote .
enron had released those figures earlier , but had yet to state in such stark terms the dire risk the debts pose to its viability .
credit could be a killer
moody ' s investors service and standard & poor ' s this month cut their respective senior unsecured debt ratings for enron to "" baa 3 "" and "" bbb - minus , "" just one notch above "" junk "" status . each warned it may cut its respective ratings again . moody ' s also cut enron ' s short - term debt rating , which affects commercial paper , to "" not prime , "" a junk rating .
in nearly all of its partnership deals , enron guaranteed the financing it received with a promise to issue enron shares to its partners if its credit fell below investment grade and its stock price was under certain levels . at the close of trading monday on the new york stock exchange , enron shares were at $ 9 . 06 - well below the trigger prices .
all of the partnerships , which enron used to finance projects in a way that kept them off the balance sheet , have become the once - proud company ' s bane . the sec is investigating potential conflict - of - interest issues involving two such partnerships on which ousted chief financial officer andrew fastow served as general partner .
enron had to extract itself from those partnerships , which led to a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in enron shareholder equity .
the revelation of the equity reduction started one of the more stunning and rapid corporate collapses in recent memory , leaving enron to be bought on nov . 9 by smaller cross - town rival dynegy inc . for the fire - sale price of $ 9 billion in stock .
in an unusual note , enron said that its financial statements in the filing were not audited by an independent accountant , per sec regulations , because of "" the need of arthur andersen llp , enron ' s independent auditors , to complete their review procedures . ""
arthur andersen had no comment , but enron said the ongoing investigation by a special committee appointed by enron ' s board of directors to look into its partnership dealings precludes the audit ' s completion .

enron warns that raft of problems may hurt its fourth - quarter profit
11 / 19 / 2001
dow jones business news
( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . )
enron corp . warned that continuing credit worries , a decline in the value of some of its assets and reduced trading activity could hurt its fourth - quarter earnings , tuesday ' s wall street journal reported .
the energy company said it may be forced to take a $ 700 million pretax hit to earnings due to a plunge in the value of assets held by one of its investment partnerships . the partnership , whitewing llp , held assets with a book value of $ 4 . 7 billion on nov . 16 but a drop in the value of enron ( ene ) stock held by the partnership could result in a derivative loss of $ 700 million , the company said .
in addition , enron , houston , said it may have to come up with more money to honor a collateral call on a $ 690 million note . that note became a "" demand obligation , "" on nov . 12 , when enron ' s credit rating got lowered to triple - b - minus by standard & poor ' s . the company didn ' t disclose who holds the note .
"" we ' ve got nine days to either repay the note or post a letter of credit or they can start liquidating assets , "" said company spokesman mark palmer . one of the assets includes c . e . g . rio , a gas distribution company in brazil that enron already is in the process of selling and whose proceeds it had intended to use for other forms of debt reduction . the company said it is trying to negotiate a waiver or extension of the credit provision with lenders to preserve its cash .
enron has set up a number of partnerships over the years to hedge investment risks and , in some cases , to keep debt off its balance sheet . in the wake of a securities and exchange commission formal probe into its accounting and disclosure practices launched oct . 31 , the company restated its earnings downward dating back to 1997 and has consolidated some debt back onto its balance sheet .
the company on nov . 9 agreed to merge with competitor dynegy inc . ( dyn ) . but its latest sec filing said it was sued by shareholders on nov . 12 in state court in houston to prevent the merger from happening . the petition alleges that enron ' s directors breached their fiduciary duties to enron ' s shareholders by agreeing to sell enron for inadequate consideration and without an adequate investigation of the alternatives available to enron . enron said it would vigorously defend itself .
monday ' s filing included numerous changes in previously reported numbers for revenues and expenses . in its original third - quarter statement , the company reported a loss of $ 618 million . the stated loss was increased to $ 635 million last week and in the latest filing , the loss for the quarter ended sept . 30 was widened to $ 664 million .
enron added that the numbers contained in latest filing aren ' t necessarily final because its external auditor , arthur andersen , hasn ' t completed its review , nor has an internal audit committee finished reviewing the firm ' s accounting practices .

enron reduces earnings , warns $ 690 mln payment due ( update 2 )
2001 - 11 - 19 22 : 03 ( new york )
enron reduces earnings , warns $ 690 mln payment due ( update 2 )
( adds in first paragraph that note payment may come next
week . )
houston , nov . 19 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . , which agreed to
a takeover by dynegy inc . after a financial crisis threatened it
with bankruptcy , revised third - quarter earnings for the second
time this month and said it may have to make early payment of a
$ 690 million note next week .
the houston - based company lowered results by 3 cents a share ,
bringing its third - quarter loss to 87 cents , or $ 664 million ,
according to a securities & exchange commission filing .
liabilities from an affiliated partnership may reduce fourth -
quarter earnings by $ 700 million before taxes , enron said .
the disclosures don ' t indicate that enron is in much worse
shape than on nov . 8 , said john olson , an energy analyst at
sanders morris harris . that ' s when enron lowered its earnings back
to 1997 by $ 586 million , reflecting losses by affiliated
partnerships that it had wrongly kept off the books .
` ` i don ' t think anyone would be particularly surprised that
they had to adjust third - quarter earnings ( again ) considering they
restated earnings for the last four years , ' ' said olson , who
doesn ' t own shares of dynegy or enron . ` ` i don ' t think it ' s a
problem . ' '
making good on debt owed by its whitewing partnership may cut
enron ' s fourth - quarter earnings . enron is obligated to back
whitewing by issuing junior convertible preferred stock . because
enron ' s stock has plunged , it may have to write down its assets by
$ 700 million , the filing said .
partnership problems
enron said that the dynegy buyout could collapse if enron is
forced to pay judgments of more than $ 2 billion to settle lawsuits
over its dealings with affiliated partnerships . dynegy has said it
can cancel the transaction if enron ' s litigation costs and other
liabilities grow to $ 3 . 5 billion or more . enron faces at least 23
such lawsuits .
enron used affiliated partnerships to raise money quickly and
take debt off its books . its shares plunged by 89 percent this
year as investors questioned whether the partnerships also were
being used to hide losses from failed investments .
chief executive officer kenneth lay said earlier this month
that buying back 62 million shares from two such partnerships cost
enron shareholders $ 1 . 2 billion in lost equity . the company wrote
off $ 1 . 01 billion in investments in water , telecommunications and
retail - energy sales in the third quarter .
a drop in enron ' s senior unsecured debt rating to ` ` bbb - ' ' by
standard & poor ' s on nov . 12 may force enron to pay off the $ 690
million note by nov . 27 if it doesn ' t find collateral to guarantee
the debt taken on by another affiliated partnership , the company
said .
brazilian liability
without repayment or collateral , investors in a partnership
that owns brazilian natural - gas assets can begin to liquidate the
partnership ' s assets , enron said . enron said it ' s working with
lenders to come up with an acceptable agreement on the debt .
` ` if we can ' t talk lenders into refinancing , there is the
possibility that . . . note would be due next week , ' ' said karen
denne , an enron spokeswoman .
as of friday , the company had $ 1 . 3 billion in cash on hand .
it expects to close on $ 450 million in additional financing
tomorrow , and to complete $ 800 million in asset sales by the end
of the year . it ' s also trying to find investors who will put $ 500
million to $ 1 billion into the company .
the company has raised cash in recent weeks by using its
pipelines as collateral . it received $ 1 . 5 billion from
chevrontexaco last week as part of the dynegy buyout agreement . in
return , dynegy acquired preferred stock and other rights in an
enron unit that owns the northern natural gas pipeline . dynegy can
acquire the pipeline even if the merger falls through .
enron closed on a $ 550 million loan from j . p . morgan chase &
co . and salomon smith barney inc . on wednesday that was secured
with assets of enron ' s transwestern pipeline co . it expects to
close on another $ 450 million loan , secured with other northern
natural gas assets , this week , denne said . the commitment for the
loans was announced nov . 1 .
$ 3 . 9 billion liability
the company also has huge liabilities that could push it into
financial crisis before the merger closes . a further drop in its
debt rating , which would put it below investment grade , would
trigger repayment of $ 3 . 9 billion in debt owed by two other
affiliated companies , enron said .
the rating drop would force it to repay $ 2 . 4 billion in debt
owed by osprey trust , and $ 915 million in debt taken on by marlin
water trust , the company said in the filing .
arthur andersen llp , enron ' s auditor , didn ' t grant final
approval of its financial statements in the filing because of an
internal investigation of its dealings with affiliated
partnerships , enron said . the sec is also investigating the
partnerships , which were run by enron executives .
the filing was released after the stock market closed . shares
of enron rose 6 cents to $ 9 . 06 . dynegy rose $ 1 . 13 to $ 43 . 60 .
chevrontexaco corp . , which owns 26 percent of dynegy and is
providing $ 2 . 5 billion in cash as part of the enron buyout , fell
54 cents to $ 82 . 91 .
chevrontexaco sees investor suits as threat to enron ( updatel )
2001 - 11 - 19 19 : 53 ( new york )
chevrontexaco sees investor suits as threat to enron ( updatel )
( updates with enron reducing third - quarter results in last
paragraph . )
new york , nov . 19 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . ' s exposure to
investor lawsuits is the biggest hurdle in its proposed buyout by
dynegy inc . , said david o ' reilly , chief executive officer of
chevrontexaco inc . , which is helping to back dynegy ' s purchase .
chevrontexaco is ` ` paying particular attention to the
litigation risk , ' ' though ` ` we still think it ' s a good deal for
dynegy and an even better deal for chevrontexaco , ' ' reilly said at
an analyst meeting in new york .
chevrontexaco , the second - biggest u . s . oil company , owns 27
percent of dynegy . it agreed to provide dynegy $ 2 . 5 billion as
part of the enron purchase . dynegy can cancel the bid if enron ' s
legal liabilities , including investor suits , exceed $ 3 . 5 billion .
enron said today in a regulatory filing it can ' t calculate the
cost of shareholder suits .
dynegy agreed 10 days ago to buy rival enron , the largest
energy trader , for stock and debt now valued at $ 20 . 7 billion .
enron ' s stock had plunged in recent weeks because of concerns it
was using affiliated partnerships to mask losses and hide debt .
gold bennett cera & sidner llp filed a class action suit in
houston today alleging enron misrepresented its business and
results . other investors have filed similar suits .
chevrontexaco will have a clearer picture of the legal risks
in the next few months , o ' reilly said . ` ` there is no transaction
that is risk free , ' ' he said .
shares of enron rose 6 cents to $ 9 . 06 today . they have
tumbled 89 percent this year . dynegy gained $ 1 . 13 to $ 43 . 60 . the
stock has declined 22 percent this year . both companies are based
in houston .
chenvrontexaco , based in san francisco , fell 54 cents to
$ 82 . 91 .
earlier this month , enron reduced its earnings in the past
four years by $ 552 million because of accounting errors involving
affiliates . enron ousted its chief financial officer , and it fired
its treasurer and a company attorney for making improper
investments in one of the affiliates .
enron reduced third - quarter earnings for a second time and
said it may have to make early payment on a $ 690 million note
this month , according to a filing with the u . s . securities and
exchange commission .
enron says it may have to pay off $ 690 mln note next week
2001 - 11 - 19 18 : 16 ( new york )
enron says it may have to pay off $ 690 mln note next week
houston , nov . 19 ( bloomberg ) - - enron said a drop in its
credit rating may force it to pay off a $ 690 million note by nov .
27 if it doesn ' t find collateral to guarantee the debt .
repayment was triggered by the nov . 12 downgrade in enron ' s
senior unsecured debt rating to bbb - by standard & poor ' s , the
company said in a securities filing .
enron must post collateral equal to the amount of the note or
repay it , the securities and exchange commission filing said .
without repayment , partners in a limited partnership that owns
natural gas assets in brazil can immediately begin to liquidate
the partnership ' s assets , enron said . enron said it ' s working with
lenders to come up with an acceptable agreement on the debt .
a further drop in its debt rating , which would put it below
investment grade , would trigger repayment of $ 3 . 9 billion in debt
owed by two affiliated companies .
the rating drop would trigger repayment of $ 2 . 4 billion in
debt owed by osprey trust , and $ 915 million owed by marlin water
trust , the company said in the filing .
enron is being bought by dynegy inc . for $ 25 billion in stock
and debt . enron also said in its filing that if shareholder
lawsuits result in judgments totaling more than $ 2 billion , the
dynegy deal could collapse .
the filing was released after the stock market closed . shares
of houston - based enron rose 6 cents to $ 9 . 06 . dynegy shares rose
$ 1 . 13 to $ 43 . 60 . shares of chevrontexaco corp . , which owns 26
percent of dynegy , fell 54 cents to $ 82 . 91 .
enron ' s azurix may have to sell assets if it can ' t borrow
2001 - 11 - 19 14 : 35 ( new york )
enron ' s azurix may have to sell assets if it can ' t borrow
houston , nov . 19 ( bloomberg ) - - azurix corp . , enron corp . ' s
water unit , may have to sell assets if it can ' t find financing to
continue operations , the company said in a regulatory filing .
enron took azurix public in june 1999 and then , after the
water company ' s stock plunged , took it private and paid off
investors in march .
azurix isn ' t sure it will be able to renew or refinance about
$ 113 . 3 million in long - term debt , including bank loans , that
matures before sept . 30 at a ` ` reasonable ' ' cost , it said in a
filing with the u . s . securities and exchange commission . the
company also had $ 326 . 3 million in short - term debt as of sept . 30 .
the loans are azurix ' s ` ` primary sources of liquidity , ' ' the
filing said . if the company can ' t raise the funds , it might have
to use the proceeds from planned asset sales to refinance debt and
get cash , the filing said .
if those asset sales don ' t generate enough money , ` ` azurix
may need to sell other assets , which could result in azurix
incurring losses in future periods , ' ' the company said .
azurix , though it still must file with the sec , no longer
trades as a separate stock . the shares of houston - based enron fell
8 cents to $ 8 . 92 in early afternoon trading .
enron agreed earlier this month to be acquired by rival
dynegy inc . in a transaction currently valued at $ 24 . 9 billion .
the buyout came after enron ' s shares plunged amid an sec
investigation of the company ' s dealings with affiliated
partnerships .
u . s . ' s dingell seeks probe of arthur andersen , dow jones says
2001 - 11 - 19 15 : 24 ( new york )
washington , nov . 19 ( bloomberg ) - - u . s . representative john
dingell , a michigan democrat , has requested a special
investigation of arthur andersen llp ' s audits of enron corp . and
waste management inc . , dow jones newswires reported .
dingell sent a letter to public oversight board chairman
charles bowsher asking for the review , the newswire said .
andersen , the world ' s fifth largest accounting firm , served
as enron ' s outside auditor for more than a decade , assuring
investors the company ' s financial statements conformed with
generally accepted accounting principles . earlier this month , the
company reported that it overstated earnings by $ 586 million over
four - and - a - half years , inflated shareholder equity by $ 1 . 2 billion
because of an ` ` accounting error , ' ' and failed to consolidate
results of three affiliated partnerships into its balance sheet .
in june , andersen reached a $ 7 million settlement with the
securities and exchange commission in which it neither admitted
nor denied allegations of fraud related to its audit of waste
management , inc . andersen is now undergoing a peer review by
deloitte & touche , dow jones said .
enron restates q 3 results
from cbs . marketwatch . com
by leticia williams
8 : 35 pm et nov 19 , 2001
washington ( cbs . mw ) - embattled enron corp . restated its third - quarter
earnings monday , increasing its loss for the period by 3 cents a share
to 87 cents , according to an sec filing .
houston - based enron ( ene ) , which is being purchased by rival dynegy to
escape a recent spate of problems and shattered wall street confidence ,
also increased nine - month earnings by a penny to 20 cents a share .
dynegy ( dyn ) is purchasing the company for $ 7 . 8 billion in stock .
enron must also pay off or refinance $ 690 million in debt obligations
by nov . 26 or risk triggering nearly $ 4 billion in additional payments ,
according to the sec filing .
if the company doesn ' t make the payment on that date , the investors
have the right to immediately begin to liquidate the assets of a certain
limited partnership for an amount equal to the note payable .
in addition , enron may sell the limited partnership ' s assets for
amounts below their carrying values .
"" the net proceeds from the sale of such assets can be used to repay
enron ' s obligation , "" according to the company ' s 10 q filed monday with
the securities and exchange commission .
enron is in talks with lenders to "" develop a mutually acceptable ""
amendment or waiver to avoid having to issue payment on the $ 690 million
note .
if the company fails to make the payment or if its credit rating falls
below investment grade , it will be forced to pay off or refinance up to
an additional $ 3 . 9 billion , the company said .
standard poor ' s currently has the company rated at bbb - , a notch
above speculative grade . fitch rates the company ' s credit at bbb - ,
evolving . moody ' s investor services rates the company baa 3 , under
review . all ratings apply to the senior unsecured debt of the
corporation .
a note trigger would force the company to repay , refinance or cash
collaterize certain facilities in the amount of $ 3 . 9 billion , which
primarily consists of $ 2 . 4 billion in osprey trust and $ 915 million in
marlin water trust , enron said in the filing .
the company ' s ( ene ) shares gained 6 cents to close at $ 9 . 06 .
company officials didn ' t immediately reply to questions about where it
would raise the money , since it ' s effectively barred from the capital
markets .",ham

"gerald / eric -
i have a couple of questions regarding tglo transport contract
012 - 88494 - 202 . we are currently delivering a volume of 28 . 000 mm into various
midcon interconnects on this contract that are designated to go to
reliant / entex for the purpose of heating hisd schools . the transport
contract stipulates different rates for this delivery depending on whether
the gas is intended for state facilities or not . my first question , then ,
is : are hisd schools considered state facilities ? and , if hisd schools are
considered state facilities , does the fact that this gas is being delivered
to them via reliant / entex utilizing midcon ' s pipe make any difference ?
i am asking these questions not only to assure that we are recouping the
correct transport rate , but also to determine what the consequences might be
if i interrupt this delivery . we are having difficulty getting enough gas
into midcon to cover our entex noms and i am just exploring my options . i
would also expect that this volume should decrease when hisd closes for the
christmas holidays - does the fact that this is an it agreement give me enough
leverage to cut this nom if tglo does not do so voluntarily ?

"puc and edison settle federal litigation to maintain utility service without raising rates
the california public utilities commission ( puc ) and southern california edison ( edison ) today reached a settlement in the filed rate doctrine lawsuit edison filed in federal court against the puc . the settlement is intended to restore edison to creditworthiness so that it is able to resume procuring the electricity needed by its customers ; limit ratepayers ' costs of paying off the debt ; and maintain the state ' s role in regulating the investor owned utility by enabling edison to pay down its back debts over a reasonable , certain period of time . the terms of the settlement agreement include :
? edison will apply cash on hand , plus all of its revenue over recoverable costs , to paying off its back debt . the puc and edison have agreed that the amount of the back debt to be recovered from ratepayers is the amount of certain outstanding debt edison had at august 31 , 2001 , less the cash on hand on that date , less an additional $ 300 million adjustment . the amount that will be paid down pursuant to the settlement agreement is estimated to be $ 3 billion as of the end of this month . the parties believe that the amount to be paid by ratepayers will be much less than the cap .
? edison will not pay any dividends on its common stock through 2003 , or on the full payment of its debt , if sooner . if edison has not fully paid its back debt by the end of 2003 , the commission retains the discretion to determine whether edison will pay a dividend in 2004 . edison is free to resume paying dividends in 2005 . since edison ' s annual dividend has typically been about $ 400 million , edison ' s shareholders will have forgone at least $ 1 . 2 billion in dividends and possibly more , in addition to the $ 300 million adjustment .
? edison will apply 100 % of any recovery it obtains from refund proceedings at the federal energy regulatory commission or litigation against sellers to pay down the back debt . edison commits through court order to work with the puc and the attorney general in pursuing litigation against the energy sellers .
? the puc can direct edison to use $ 150 million each year for other utility purposes , including the provision of additional energy efficiency monies , which would otherwise be used to pay down the edison debt .
? the puc agrees not to lower edison ' s retail rates below their current level through the end of 2003 unless the back debts are recovered . however , rates may be reduced as a result of a securitization of the debt or reduced dwr revenue needs .
? the puc agrees to set rates not higher than the current rate , to enable edison to recover the remaining amount of the back debt over 2004 and 2005 if edison ' s back debt has not been recovered by the end of 2003 .
? there are no concessions of puc or state regulations or regulatory authority over edison , nor is there any deregulation of valuable transmission and generation facilities .
? edison may make up to $ 900 million in capital expenditures annually .
"" this settlement embodies a fair and judicious way for edison to become solvent and get back in the business of buying power , while meeting the needs of ratepayers and the state of california , "" said loretta lynch , president of the puc . "" the settlement also ensures that all of the benefits of any refunds arising through litigation against power generators and marketers that profited from unjust and unreasonable energy prices will benefit ratepayers . ""
this agreement settles a november 2000 federal court lawsuit filed by edison against the puc , in which edison claimed that the commission ' s actions in not providing sufficient retail rates , violated federal law and was an unconstitutional taking of its property . under this agreement , edison will release the puc from all claims in its lawsuit and will also withdraw any challenges to the commission ' s decisions implementing ab lx , ab 6 x , and the turn accounting proposal .

subject : california update - - 10 . 02 . 01 : part 2 : puc approves edison bailout
in another surprise move , the puc approved an edison bailout today on a 5 - 0 vote . this item was not on the commission ' s agenda other than as a placeholder regarding "" litigation . "" we do not have copies of the agreement but we just talked to edison ' s svp of regulatory affairs and here ' s a summary :
the commission will keep current rates in place through 2003
any "" overcollection "" resulting from keeping current rates in place will go to paying off $ 3 . 3 b in edison ' s past due accounts ( the so - called "" undercollection "" )
if edison collects the $ 3 . 3 b prior to 2003 , then rates can change
if edison has not collected the $ 3 . 3 b by the end of 2003 , the puc will create a dedicated rate component on all bills to collect the remainder . half the remainder will be collected in 2004 and the other half in 2005 .
any refunds received from litigation against suppliers will go to reducing the $ 3 . 3 b undercollection .
edison can keep 10 % of any refunds received after the $ 3 . 3 b is paid off .
edison cannot pay any dividends during the time that it is using rates to pay off the $ 3 . 3 b .
edison can apply to the puc for approval to hedge gas price risk .
edison will be protected from any increases in dwr contract costs ( i . e . , if dwr ' s costs go up , the puc will raise rates rather than take it out of edison ' s rates )
the puc will not fine edison during this period if edison ' s capital structure varies from the puc - approved capital structure
edison must drop its lawsuits against the puc regarding 1 ) the "" filed rate doctrine "" and 2 ) the so - called "" turn "" accounting method , which effectively kept the rate freeze in place .
edison agrees to "" cooperate "" with the attorney general and the puc in all litigation against suppliers .
the puc decision could likely nullify the need for the "" special "" session that the governor recently announced
we will report back with additional details as soon as we get them .
best ,
jeff

subject : california update - - 10 . 02 . 01 : puc turns down davis ' proposed rate agreement with dwr
in what will likely be viewed as a fairly shocking event , the california puc today voted down davis ' proposed rate agreement between dwr and the cpuc .
the vote was 4 - 1 , with the two republicans voting with davis ' hand - picked appointees lynch and wood .
davis ' proposal was introduced at the meeting by another davis appointee - - geoff brown - - who made a lengthy speech about why california would experience economic and political destruction if the puc did not approve davis ' proposed rate agreement .
what is davis ' proposed rate agreement between dwr and the cpuc ?
it would remove all puc authority to review any contracts between dwr with suppliers .
it would require the puc to pass through to utility rates all dwr power contract costs , no questions asked .
what are the implications of the move by the puc to reject davis ' proposal ?
with the vote , it remains unclear how california / dwr will pay for the dwr power contracts .
the political pressure to re - negotiate - - or break - - the dwr power contracts is likely to intensify considerably .
it remains unclear how california / dwr will pay for the $ 12 . 5 b in bonds the treasurer has unsuccessfully attempted to issue for past several months .
under the structure devised by davis , the revenues flowing from the cpuc / dwr rate agreement would be used to both 1 ) pay for the dwr power contracts and 2 ) service the bonds the treasurer is trying to issue to repay california ' s general fund for spot and other short term power purchased by dwr since january .
in short , there is no clear indication of how california will pay for dwr contracts or issue the bonds .
safe to say that today ' s puc vote has seriously embarrassed davis , and left his approach to "" solving "" california electricity crisis in shambles .
what next ?
a broad left - right coalition of energy interests supported a bill ( 18 xx ) that passed the legislature with broad bi - partisan support .
the bill would create a "" dedicated rate component "" on every customers bill to service the $ 12 . 5 b in bonds that the treasurer wants to issue .
proponents of the bill - - and just about everyone else - - argue that the "" dedicated rate component "" is a signficantly more efficient way to raise the debt california needs to plug the hole in its budget .
the bill is silent , however , on how california would pay for the dwr contracts , and the bill ' s opponents claim that the power suppliers will sue as a result .
all four puc commissioners who voted against the davis rate agreement today urged davis to sign the bill . the left - right coalition ( from nader types to oil companies ) is also working hard to get davis to sign it .
davis has said that he will veto the bill on the advice of the treasurer and bond counsel .
given today ' s vote , however , davis may have no alternative than to sign the bill if he wants to get the bonds issued and the state budget repaid .
update on edison bailout
still appears that chances are very small that edison and davis will succeed in getting the legislature to vote for an edison bailout when it returns for another "" special "" session next tuesday .
if you have any questions , just let us know .

hi vince ,
i am writing you at this time to inquire as to the potential of renewing my
internship at enron for the summer of 2000 .
while the date of my request is later than i would have wished , the reason
is that i had originally planned to go back to turkey this summer and get
my mandatory military duty done . however , i now realize i can put it off to
a further date . that left me wondering if you believe there is a project
that i can get involved in this summer and be useful . if that were the
case , i would be more than happy to postpone my military duty and spend the
summer with the research group . i discussed this with dr . ronn , and he is
very supportive of this idea .
i apologize again for bringing up this issue late , and look forward to
hearing from you .

"based on the conversation we had at the meeting last thursday , i am
implementing the following changes to humble gas pipeline and king ranch gas
plant . if you disagree or feel you had a different understanding than the
items below , please be sure to call me asap .
1 . input hplc purchase from hplr liquids at meter 8793 ( hpl / hgpl ) . remove
the 3 rivers gas from the interconnect ticket and input on
the purchase deal .
2 . input hplc sale to hplr liquids at meters 9643 ( kgpl / hpl ) and 12
( kgpl / hgpl ) . remove 3 rivers volumes from the interconnect tickets
at these meters and input on the sales deals appropriately .
3 . change swing parameters for the king ranch contracts to swing on cage
ranch before swinging on 3 rivers gas . this will hopefully allow
the sale for 3 rivers gas to remain at one meter as much as possible .
i will hopefully have all of these changes made by the end of the day , and
have all contracts repathed . it is my understanding that we are implementing
these changes effective feb . lst .
stella , this may or may not effect repathing of the hplc gas at meter 9643 ,
based on the swing parameters that you have been using .
thank you .",ham

enron building . this outage was caused by localized structural failure of
the raised floor in our 34 th floor data center . this resulted in disruption
to the power distribution system servicing the phone switch and a number of
ena servers .
as a cautionary move , enron online was interrupted while the extent of the
failure was assessed , resulting in the system being unavailable from 11 : 23 to
11 : 39 . all enron building telephones and voicemail were unavailable for
approximately one hour and 20 minutes and certain ena trading systems were
unavailable for over two hours . during this time the power was stabilized
and systems were restored . immediate steps are being taken to correct this

hello ,
do accept my sincere apologies if my mail does not meet your personal ethics .
i will introduce myself as mr . lang owen , a staff in the accounts management
section of the above firm here in the united kingdom .
one of our accounts with holding balance of £ 15 , 000 , 000 ( fifteen million
british pounds ) has been dormant and has not been operated for the past
four ( 4 ) years .
from my investigations and confirmations , the owner of this account , a foreigner
by name kurt kahle died in july , 2000 see this http : / / news . bbc . co . uk / 1 / hi / world / europe / 859479 . stm
and since then nobody has done anything as regards the claiming of this
money because he has no family members who are aware of the existence of
neither the account nor the funds .
i have secretly discussed this matter with a senior official of this company
and we have agreed to find a reliable foreign partner to deal with . we thus
propose to do business with you , standing in as the next of kin of these
funds from the deceased and funds released to you after due processes have
been followed .
this transaction is totally free of risk and as the fund is legitimate and
does not originate from drug , money laundry , terrorism or any other illegal
act . on receipt of your response i will furnish you with detailed clarification
as it relates to this mutual benefit transaction .
i look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible if you are interested .

i ' m not sure if you can help me , but i have a danny conner deal from december 2000 that has a price issue .
we were buying gas from the houston exploration company on black marlin , high island 138 / hpl meter 98663 , deal 508426 . the deal was priced at hsc - 0 . 14 . in december , a new platform came on , high island 115 / hpl meter 986431 . it did not start flowing until the 20 th . danny did not put a new deal in for this meter , so we combined the gas on deal 508426 . the houston exploration thinks that the gas at hi 115 should be kept separate and priced at hsc gd - 0 . 14 since it did not begin flowing until the 20 th . we agree that we received the gas . we have the pipeline statement from black marlin . we just don ' t have the same pricing . the houston exploration shows that we owe them an additional $ 222 k due to this price difference . we only purchased this gas in dec 2000 and jan 2001 . the deal for jan , 547063 , was priced at gd - 0 . 14 . can you verify how this deal should be priced ? i sent this issue to danny back in january and he said the if price was correct , but the houston exploration is sticking to their price . if you need to talk to their trader , his name is lester lipperdt 713 - 830 - 6960 .

subject : working together on the valuation model
all ,
as we go forward on the next revision of the valuation model ( due late next week or early the next for the offsite ) , it is important that we all understand and embrace some basic ground rules . i ' ve got some suggestions below and would like to hear any that you have :
in order to maintain coordination and control of the information - for the betterment of us all - i think we ought to give one person version control responsibility over the model . this person should be advised when the model is updated . relating things like the effects on the valuation and reasons for the updating also seem pertinent . version control is critical if we are to maintain consistency in our approach to upper management .
related to this , rahil should be made aware when the model is distributed to upper management ( both sally and greg ) and be given the opportunity to give feedback before hand .
just basic stuff , but if we can all agree to maintain this protocol before we go much further , we should be able to avoid any unnecessary complications .
thanks ,
fred

subject : prudency
please see the attached draft prudency policy and prudency schedule . barry ,
i need your comments asap . i am in meetings until around 11 : 00 tomorrow .
i don ' t think we can argue that we no longer need prudency without it being a
change in accounting policy . this years annual report fn - 3 stills contains
the following statement :
the values are adjusted to reflect the potential impact of liquidating
enron  , s position in
an orderly manner over a reasonable period of time under present market
conditions .
i think the best we can argue is 1 ) that the liquidity in some commodities
( gas for u . s . and maybe power for u . k . ) has increased to a level that
prudency is no longer required and 2 ) setting a minimum level of var before
prudency is required are not a wholesale change in our accounting policy .
i have not attempted to address establishing an operational reserve . i think
the two are separate , but no reason why we can ' t create one this quarter .
wes , i need to get with you to determine what ena would like to do . the
earnings situation may be different than expected . ena has taken a large
amount out of prudency ( see the attached schedule ) . we can probably argue
for that release to be reduced , pending complete research on power liquidity
and implementation of the new rac calculation . i obviously will not hold any
discussions with aa .
let me know what the next steps are . i will be waiting to hear from you both .

"greetings ,
i am prince fayad w . bolkiah , the eldest son of prince jefri bolkiah , former finance minister of brunei , the tiny oil - rich sultanate on the northern coast of the island of borneo , in eastern asia . i will save your time by not amplifying my extended royal family history , which has already been disseminated by the international media during the controversial dispute that erupted between my father and his step brother , the sultan of brunei sheik muda hassanal bolkiah .
as you may know from the international media , the sultan had accused my father of financial mismanagement and impropriety of us $ 14 . 8 billion dollars . this was as a result of the asian financial crisis that made my father company amedeo development company and government owned brunei investment company to be declared bankrupt during his tenure in office . however my father was kept under house arrest , his bank accounts and private properties including a crude oil export refinery were later confiscated by the sultanate .
furthermore , during this unfortunate period i was advised to evacuate my immediate family outside the sultanate to avoid further prosecution from the sultan and his security operatives , but before i could do that i was placed under house arrest by the sultan and i have no access to a phone but i have a palm v hand - held computer from which i am sending you this mail . before my incaceration , i went ahead to dispatch the sum of fifty eight million five hundred thousand united states dollars us $ 58 . 5 million in cash under special arrangement into the custody of a private security and trustee company for safe keeping abroad .
hence i seek your good assistance to invest these funds into profitable investment in your country to facilitate future survival for my family abroad . i have decided to offer 10 % of these funds to you as compensation for your strong cooperation .
please i count on your absolute confidentiality , transparency and trust while looking forward to your prompt reply towards a swift conclusion of this business transaction .
i remain yours sincerely .

"we are proposing the following changes to the calculation of ng correlations :
1 . weight the data set ( 3 calendar months ) used in calculating correlations
( most recent data weighed heavier )
2 . use respective contract prices , instead of prompt month prices ( i . e . for
nov - 00 correlations use nov contract prices for the last 3 months , as opposed
to prompt month prices for the last three months .
tanya ,
i have confirmed with ted and he gave us green light to make both changes .
did we get an opinion from vince ?
winston ,
it is my understanding , that this changes apply to ng correlations only , not
the correlations between commodities . we will test the changes in gas and
then decide on world - wide implementation . any estimate on timing of this
implementation ?
cassandra ,
ted suggested that you and veronica should document this as a change in var
parameters and inform all commercial desk heads of these changes . we intend
to make them for na gas first , but ultimately make these changes consistent
across all commodity groups . let me know if you have questions .

vlady ,
also in the meeting , we identified that there are still some issures
regarding to the correlation matrix calculations .
since different commodity has different expiration dates . when calculate
correlation between two commodities , the two may have different prompt
months . are we going to use prices on two different prompt months or are we
going to use the prices on the same month disregarding prompt months .
because above issues , jin is not going do any changes on the correlation
matrix calculation until above issures can be solved .

vlady , we met with winston and jin today regarding var calibration issues .
the outcome on this discussion is :
1 . jin will put weights into calculation of factor loadings ;
2 . jin will change the way factor loading are calculated . for each commodity
the prompt month contract will be selected for the effective date of vatrfacs
run .
then the historical prices will be collected for 3 month for all forward
contracts starting from
selected prompt month contract . the variance - covariance matrix will be
calculated
based on these data , it will be converted into correlation matrix , then
factor loadings
analysis will be performed on the correlation matrix .

dear sir / madam
seeking your immediate assistance .
please permit me to make your acquaintance in so informal a manner . this
is necessitated by my urgent need to reach a
dependable and trust worthy foreign partner . this request may seem strange
and unsolicited but i crave your indulgence
and pray that you view it seriously . my name is col . michael bundu of the
democratic republic of congo and one of
the close aides to the former president of the democratic republic of
congo laurent kabila of blessed memory , may
his soul rest in peace .
due to the military campaign of laurent kabila to force out the rebels in
my country , i and some of my colleagues were
instructed by late president kabila to go abroad to purchase arms and
ammunition worth of twenty million , five hundred
thousand united states dollars only ( us $ 20 , 500 , 000 . 00 ) to fight the rebel
group . we were then given this money privately
by the then president , laurent kabila , without the knowledge of other
cabinet members . but when president kabila
was killed in a bloody shoot - out by one of his bodyguards a day before we
were schedule to travel out of congo , we
immediately decided to put the funds into a private security company here
in congo for safe keeping . the security of the
said amount is presently being threatened here following the arrest and
seizure of properties of col . rasheidi karesava
( one of the aides to laurent kabila ) a tribesman , and some other military
personnel from our same tribe , by the new
president of the democratic republic of congo , the son of late president
laurent kabila , joseph kabila .
in view of this , we need a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner who
can assist us to move this money out of my country
as the beneficiary .
we have sufficient ' ' contacts ' ' here to move the fund under diplomatic
cover to a security company in europe in your
name . this is to ensure that the diplomatic baggage is marked
' ' confidential ' ' and it
will not pass through normal custom / airport screening and clearance .
our inability to move this money out of congo all this while stems from
our lack of trust of our supposed good friends
( western countries ) who suddenly became hostile to those of us who worked
with the late president kabila , immediately
after his son took office . though we have neither seen nor met each other ,
the information we gathered from an associate
who has worked in your country has encouraged and convinced us that with
your sincere assistance , this transaction will
be properly handled with modesty and honesty to a huge success within two
weeks . the said money is a state fund and
therefore requires a total confidentiality .
we would please need you to stand on our behalf as the beneficiary of this
fund in europe . this is because we are under
restricted movement and watch and hence we want to be very careful in
order not to lose this fund which we have worked
so hard for . thus , if you are willing to assist us to move this fund out
of congo , you can contact me through my email
addresses , tel / fax nos . above with your telephone , fax number and personal
information to enable us discuss the
modalities and what will be your share ( percentage ) for assisting us .
please note that there are no risks involved in this deal as everyone ' s
security is guaranteed if we follow the required
guidelines . i will hence furnish you with further details of this deal as
soon as i am assured of your sincere interest to assist
us .
i must use this opportunity and medium to implore you to exercise the
utmost indulgence to keep this matter extraordinarily
confidential , whatever your decision , while i await your prompt response .
thank you and god bless .
best regards

"i have felt a renewed heart for god , a fresh spirit . i have been in the word lately and doug and i have to committed to prayer time together each morning . it has brought a more positive attitude , much joy , and thankfulness on my part . and , yes , satan has already tried to steal that joy . but he will not prevail , i will not let him . so in those times when i feel that any bit of joy is seeping away , i begin to pray . i found this prayer to be refreshing and worded well . please read it , it may just jumpstart your day and you ' ll be filled with joy . have a great day ! amber
please take a moment to relax your mind and
humble your heart to focus on christ .
allow god , to be the only person on your

things . let me not whine and
whimper over things i have no control over . let
me continue to see sin
through god ' s eyes and acknowledge it as evil .
and when i sin , let me
repent , and confess with my mouth my wrongdoing ,
and receive the forgiveness
of god .
and when this world closes in on me , let me
remember jesus ' example - to
slip away and find a quiet place to pray . it ' s
the best response when i ' m
pushed beyond my limits . i know that when i can ' t
pray , you listen to my heart . continue to use me to do
your will . ? continue to bless me that i may
be a blessing to others .
keep me strong that i may help the weak . keep me
uplifted that i may have

"john ,
this is the update on what i have done for the lng transactions .
1 . i was not involved in the lng ship project . i shall read the dash
and give you my comments . without looking at the details , i think that the
decision
to charter a tanker removes one significant risk we have at the elba island
project ( please , see point 2 ) .
2 . elba island . i am working with doug rotenberbg , brad hitch , scott earnest
( sally beck ' s organization ) and rac to set up the book for the elba island
transaction . the next step
will be to expand the book to capture all the enron ' s lng - related positions
in one place and
to look for natural risk offsets and possible hedges . a working group is
meeting to close a few
remaining gaps tomorrow ( tuesday ) at 8 : 30 .
a few comments on the book design and my view of the project :
a . the current thinking is that lng will be sourced for the elba island
facility
by buying marginal cargos on the fob basis . marginal cargos will represent
supply from excess capacity that has not been committed under long - term
contracts or became available due to some short - term frictions .
the fob cargos are typically selling at a significant discount to the
long - term
contract prices . the economics of the deal , as represented by the book we are
setting up , will reflect the assumption that not only we can locate marginal
cargos
but that we shall be able to do it on a regular basis , arranging shipping and
coordinating
the facility schedule and natural gas transactions in the us . in other words ,
we have a significant logistical and operational risk in this transaction .
b . the transaction will cover the period of 17 years ( with an extension
option of
5 years ) . even if we can lock - in the lng volumes over this time period , we
have no ability to lock - in the other side of the spread ( us gas prices ) for
such a long tenor . this is
essentially a tolling transaction with exposure to the lng - nat gas spread
and
i would not recommend locking - in only one leg of the spread .
one solution would be to cover , let ' s say , 50 % of he lng volumes for the
first
5 years and lock - in the nat gas side on the us market side .
c . the book we are setting up will be based on many managerial assumptions
regarding sources of lng , shipping rates , schedules , etc . i would set up a
big prudence reserve
in case we mark it to market .
d . my group will work on valuation of some options we have in the elba island
deal
( that are good for enron ) and on the hedging strategy for the lng positions .
long - term lng contracts are typically based on the japanese crude cocktail
that
correlates very well with brent .

i haven ' t spoken to you for awhile but hope the world is treating you well .
anyway with greg moving to his

i understand that your group is taking a first cut at developing curves for
lng and lng ship values . i also understand
that another lng ship decision is on the dockets for may 19 ( not very far
away ) . anway i understand this
is a big decision but i still have gotten very little info yet . can you
please let me know where you stand now ?
i will ask my assistant lauren to set up a time that i can speak with you in

"as evidenced by an exceptionally strong performance in the second quarter ,
enron  , s wholesale energy businesses in north america and europe continue to
experience tremendous growth . the opportunities to continue to grow our
natural gas and power businesses have never been better and it is critical to
enron  , s future success that we remain focused on expanding these businesses
and maintaining the strong momentum we have in these markets .
it is equally important that we continue to develop new businesses outside of
gas and electricity , which can make significant contributions to our earnings
growth . we have made significant progress in developing these businesses in
north america , europe , and most recently in our new net works business unit .
included in these global businesses are our efforts in crude and products ,
coal , emissions , insurance , currency , equity trading , interest rates , credit
trading , paper and pulp , and metals .
while significant progress has been made in these efforts we need to
accelerate the growth of these new businesses while continuing to
aggressively expand our core gas and electricity businesses in north america
and europe . in order to accomplish these two objectives and to capitalize on
the increasingly global opportunities in these new businesses we are today
announcing the formation of a new business unit  ) enron global markets . this
new business unit will focus on markets and commodities which are global in
scope , but outside our traditional gas and power markets . this new core
business unit will operate in parallel with and in close coordination with
the north american and european businesses .
enron global markets will be headed by mike mcconnell , president and chief
executive officer , and jeff shankman , chief operating officer . they will
report to mark frevert who will be chairman of enron global markets . mark ,
mike and jeff will comprise the office of the chairman for enron global
markets .
included in this new business unit and reporting to the office of the
chairman will be the following businesses and their leaders :
- global crude and products : john nowlan
- coal : george mcclellan
- currency , equities , interest rate and agricultural trading : gary hickerson
- insurance and weather : jere overdyke
enron  , s metals business and enron credit . com will remain the responsibility
of enron europe . the paper and pulp business will continue to reside in north
america .
with the departure of mike mcconnell from enron net works , we are pleased to

enron asks citigroup for $ 750 mln loan , people say ( updatel )
( adds comment from cfo fastow in fourth paragraph , enron ' s
short - term borrowing rates in seventh paragraph . )
new york , oct . 23 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . , the biggest
energy trader , has asked citigroup inc . to arrange a $ 750 million
loan , ensuring access to credit if the embattled company is cut
off from money markets , say people familiar with the matter .
enron ' s shares and bonds plunged yesterday after the company
said the securities and exchange commission was probing its
finances . the houston - based business , whose stock has fallen 75
percent this year amid concerns about failed investments , depends
on a $ 3 billion commercial paper , or short - term debt , program to
finance day - to - day operations .
earlier this month , moody ' s investors service placed all $ 13
billion of the company ' s long - term debt securities on watch for
possible downgrade . as a second - tier commercial paper borrower ,
any drop in its rating may cut off enron from the commercial paper
market and raise the costs of short - term debt .
` ` we understand that our credit rating is critical to both
the capital markets and our counterparties , ' ' enron ' s chief
financial officer andrew fastow said on a conference call today .
he said enron has $ 3 . 5 billion available on bank credit lines ,
giving it enough cash to operate normally .
enron shares rose as much as 12 . 6 percent during the call to
$ 23 . 25 . they pared the gain to $ 21 . 80 , up $ 1 . 15 .
dan noonan , a spokesman for citigroup ' s citibank na unit ,
declined to comment . mark palmer , a spokesman for enron , declined
to comment .
commercial paper rates
enron was paying 3 . 15 percent to issue commercial paper until
oct . 31 , which is as much as 15 basis points more than companies
with the same ` ` a 2 / p 2 ' ' short - term credit ratings that are not on
credit watch . enron ' s short - term debt is not on review for a
possible downgrade .
enron has previously turned to citigroup for finance and
advice . in 1999 , citigroup ' s salomon smith barney unit advised the
company on its $ 1 . 45 billion acquisition of three natural gas -
fired power plants from cogen technologies inc . citibank , along
with j . p . morgan chase & co . , this year arranged a $ 1 . 75 billion
loan .
earlier this week , an investor sued enron , saying two
partnerships cost the company $ 35 million and fastow ' s leadership
of them was a conflict of interest .
the sec has asked enron about partnerships and affiliated
companies headed by fastow . dismantling some of the partnerships
would cost enron or its shareholders as much as $ 3 billion , ray
niles , a salomon smith barney analyst , wrote in a report to
investors .
enron created partnerships and affiliated companies to buy
and sell assets such as power plants to lower the debt on its
books .
investors said they were concerned that enron may be forced
to dismantle the affiliated companies by paying off the owners in
cash or stock . chief executive ken lay said last week he may have
to ` ` unravel ' ' agreements that created the companies if enron ' s
debt ratings fall too far .

enron says shareholders ' ' best interests ' were sought in all ljm dealings
10 / 23 / 2001
afx news
( c ) 2001 by afp - extel news ltd
new york ( afx ) - enron corp said it sought the "" best interests "" of its shareholders in all its dealings with ljm cayman lp and ljm 2 co - investment lp , two partnerships which were set - up and run until recently by enron chief financial officer andrew fastow .
"" the board ( of enron ) was fully aware and kept a real chinese wall between enron and ljm . enron ' s shareholders best interests were sought in all ljm dealings , "" said enron chief executive officer kenneth lay , in a conference call with analysts .
the company scheduled the call after enron ' s stock slid 21 pct yesterday , when it revealed the securities and exchange commission asked the company to provide information on certain related - party transactions .
overnight , two class action lawsuits were launched by shareholders against enron and its officers , alleging that operating results were also "" materially overstated "" as a result of the company failing to timely write - down the value .
in its third - quarter results last week , enron announced a charge of 1 . 01 bln usd , of 1 . 11 usd per share , and an incremental 1 . 2 bln usd reduction in stockholders ' equity , related to the unwinding of investments with the ljm partnerships .
according to the wall street journal , fastow resigned from the partnerships in july , due to growing suspicion over potential conflicts of interests .
during the call , lay said that he , and enron ' s board of directors , have "" the highest faith and confidence in ( fastow ) . ""
lay also said the company remained confident that its current liquidity position allows it to meet all its obligations , and is confident of the outlook for its corporate rating .
analysts have raised the possibility that , should enron ' s credit rating and stock price continue to fall , the company may be obligated to issue millions of new shares to meet obligations with other entities it deals with .

afx news
( c ) 2001 by afp - extel news ltd
new york ( afx ) - milberg weiss bershad hynes & lerach llp law firm said it filed a class action lawsuit yesterday against enron corp alleging that it issued misleading statements between jan 18 , 2000 and oct 17 , 2001 , thereby inflating the company ' s share price artificially .
the suit was filed on behalf of enron shareholders between the above period and is pending in the us district court in houston against enron corp , enron ceo kenneth lay , former enron ceo jeffrey skilling , who resigned recently , and enron chief financial officer andrew fastow .
the suit claims that enron issued statements which failed to disclose that the company was experiencing a declining demand for bandwidth and that its efforts to create a trading market for bandwidth failed because many market participants were not creditworthy .
the company ' s operating results were also "" materially overstated as result of the company failing to timely write - down the value of its investments with certain limited partnerships "" managed by the company ' s cfo . the suit additionally alleges that enron was failing to write - down impaired assets on a timely basis in accordance with gaap .
on oct 16 , enron announced unexpectedly that it was taking third quarter non - recurring charges of 1 . 01 bln after - tax , or 1 . 11 usd per share , which it later revealed was due largely to the unwinding of investments with certain limited partnerships controlled by enron ' s chief financial officer . enron also announced it was cutting shareholder equity by 1 . 2 bln usd .
enron ' s share price consequently fell sharply . during the class period , enron insiders disposed of 73 mln usd of personally - held enron common stock .
holders of enron stock between the class period in question may request appointment as a lead plaintiff no later than dec 21 , milberg weiss said .
yesterday , enron announced that the securities and exchange commission has requested that it provide information regarding certain related party transactions .

new york - shares of enron corp . slumped more than 20 % yesterday after it said u . s . regulators are looking into company transactions , another blow to a company whose chief executive resigned in august .
a spokesman for north america ' s biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity declined to discuss an inquiry by the u . s . securities exchange commission , but said it was cooperating .
the sec also declined to outline details of its inquiry .
investor confidence in the company has been rocked by reports from the wall street journal about its relationship with two limited partnerships that were run until recently by enron ' s chief financial officer , andrew fastow .
the company also reported last week its first quarterly loss in more than four years , and took us $ 1 . 01 - billion in charges and writedowns on ill - fated investments .
problems at enron surfaced two months ago when ceo jeff skilling resigned after six months at the helm .
enron shares declined us $ 5 . 49 , or 21 % , to us $ 20 . 56 in afternoon trade on the new york stock exchange yesterday , shaving off almost us $ 4 . 2 - billion of its market capitalization .
the stock , the biggest decliner by percentage loss on the nyse , fell as much as 22 . 8 % yesterday , when it opened at its lowest level since september 1998 .
enron declined to comment on whether the sec ' s inquiry into "" certain related - party transactions "" involved the partnerships .
"" related - party transactions "" is the heading used by enron in its 1999 and 2000 annual reports to discuss dealings with its limited partnerships , ljm cayman lp and the larger ljm 2 co - investment lp , which engaged in complex hedging transactions involving company assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars .
mr . fastow severed his ties with the partnerships in june . ljm was set up in june 1999 for energy - related investments , and ljm 2 in december 1999 for energy - and communication - related investments .
the journal reported us $ 35 - million of its third - quarter loss of us $ 638 - million were connected with the limited partnerships
curt launer , an analyst at credit suisse first boston , said investors should question enron ' s use of real value accounting when the value of certain assets , "" most notably in telecommunications , "" have declined precipitously .
"" investors have had several opportunities to question enron ' s credibility and at each of those turns the share price has declined , "" launer said .
some analysts , though , cautioned against assuming fire when there might only be smoke .
"" this is an inquiry , not an investigation , and i cannot imagine enron ' s attorneys or accountants would allow it do to something illegal , "" said merrill lynch analyst donato eassey .
"" it ' s easy for the market to kick a company when its down , but these challenges do not last for a solid company , and we think enron is one . ""
the price of shares in the company is down 75 % this year .

in new york
enron , the american power giant , saw its shares slump by a fifth yesterday after it revealed that the top financial watchdog is delving into firms managed by chief financial officer andrew fastow .
the securities and exchange commission is requesting details of deals between the company and limited partnerships with which mr fastow has , or had , links .
enron chairman kenneth lay said in a statement : "" we welcome this request . we will co - operate fully and look forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest . ""
questions were raised last week on wall street after the company announced a write - down of more than $ 1 billion due to failed investments in telecoms and other businesses .
the disclosure alarmed investors and sent the already battered shares down 23 pc . yesterday they fell another $ 5 . 30 ( # 3 . 80 ) to $ 20 . 75 in early trading .
according to the annual report the "" related party transactions "" , as enron describes them , took place in 1999 and 2000 , resulting in losses of $ 16 m and $ 36 m respectively .
mr lay said that auditors approved the deals , but would not give further details of what they were .
they are understood to have been hedging transactions against enron shares and other assets made by partnerships called ljm cayman lp and ljm 2 co - investment jp .
"" we believe everything that needed to be considered and done in connection with these transactions was considered and done , "" added mr lay .
the relationship between the investment losses and the sec probe is not clear , though the inquiry seems to focus on the partnerships responsible for the hedging transactions .
enron owns teesside power station and wessex water in britain and is the largest trader of natural gas in the us . investors are concerned that the probe and the continued uncertainty about the extent of the problem will harm the company ' s credit rating .
an enron spokesman said mr fastow continues to work and is not under any suspicion .
the sec inquiry is "" informal "" , says the company . the watchdog contacted enron last wednesday , the day of the results announcement . the sec declined to comment .
enron made a loss of $ 638 m in the third quarter , its first in over four years .

shares of enron corp . set a 52 - week low monday on word that the securities and exchange commission had asked for information about a complex series of financial transactions between the houston - based energy giant and an investment partnership tied to a company executive .
enron , the world ' s largest energy trader , said it had voluntarily provided information on "" certain related - party transactions "" that had been previously disclosed to the sec .
"" we welcome this request , "" said kenneth l . lay , enron chairman and chief executive .
"" we will cooperate fully with the sec and look forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest , "" he said .
the sec request is the latest in a parade of bad news for enron , which has seen investments sour in telecommunications , retail electricity sales and water .
investors have battered the company ' s stock , which once sold for nearly $ 85 a share in the last year , and many have criticized enron ' s stingy meting out of financial information . but several wall street analysts remain upbeat on the stock , noting that the bulk of its businesses continue to thrive despite the growing economic downturn .
in august , enron chief executive jeffrey k . skilling , one of the main architects of the company ' s strategy of shedding physical assets in search of trading profit , stunned wall street by resigning .
skilling cited personal , family - related reasons , but later he acknowledged that the precipitous plunge in the company ' s stock price contributed to his departure .
on monday , enron shares plunged $ 5 . 40 , or nearly 21 % , to close at $ 20 . 65 on the new york stock exchange .
enron ' s stock has lost nearly 40 % of its value in the last week since it reported a surprise third - quarter loss of $ 618 million after $ 1 . 01 billion in charges reflecting the costs of recent failed investments .
but the charge also included $ 35 million related to what enron described only as the "" early termination during the third quarter of certain structured finance arrangements with a previously disclosed entity . ""
in a conference call with securities analysts about the earnings , the company mentioned that it had repurchased 55 million shares as part of the dissolution of its participation in the transactions .
but investors were stunned when stories last week in the wall street journal detailed that the transactions were with a limited partnership organized by andrew s . fastow , enron ' s chief financial officer , and that enron had whittled $ 1 . 2 billion off its shareholder equity as it repurchased the shares and canceled a $ 1 . 2 - billion note it had received from the partnership . shareholder equity now stands at $ 9 . 5 billion .
the limited partnership , called ljm 2 , and fastow reaped millions of dollars of profit through complex hedging transactions that involved enron assets and stock , the journal reported .
lay said the transactions were reviewed by auditors and lawyers inside and outside the company and that the company board was fully informed .
a shareholder lawsuit charging that enron ' s directors violated their fiduciary duty already has been filed in texas state court .
many companies set up limited partnerships for tax purposes , but it is unusual to allow company executives to run them , analyst say .
investors also are upset by the unusually zealous way that enron has guarded financial information , making it difficult to analyze the company ' s complex web of businesses .
and many are not confident that all the bad news has been released .
analyst m . carol coale , who follows enron and other energy companies for prudential securities in houston , downgraded enron to a "" hold "" from a "" buy "" rating monday out of such frustration .
coale said she has been getting misinformation or no information out of enron .
but bob christensen , energy analyst with first albany corp . , said that despite enron ' s recent difficulties , the bulk of the business remains strong .
"" i continue to tell investors that 70 % of this company ' s business is growing at a 26 % rate , and that was in the third quarter when this country had a very sharp economic slowdown going on , "" he said .
investors are panicking because of a "" bad news story that doesn ' t reflect reality , "" said jon kyle cartwright , senior energy analyst with the raymond james

"ca reviews state power auction results
california ' s closely watched entry into the long - term , bulk power market
turned up 39 bidders at an average 6 . 9 cents / kwh price , the governor ' s office
reported late wednesday , as the state government finished its whirlwind
27 - hour , sealed - bid power auction .
gov . gray davis said the state received a "" very representative bid with a
good deal of power bid for , and it was a very good sample , certainly one that
gives us all optimism . ""
tom hannigan , director of the state water resource department who oversaw the
auction , said the state obtained "" a useful sample across all times of the day
across the spectrum of the year , and we are quite pleased with the initial
results . i look forward to looking through bids and developing some long - term
contracts . our fundamental responsibility here is to purchase power at the
best possible prices for consumers and businesses . ""
on wednesday as the bids from the internet - based auction were initially
accessed , davis said he expected a new law from the state legislature by feb .
1 , giving the state authority to consummate deals involving the best of the
bids received in the quick - turnaround auction .
the bids covered six - month , three - , five - and 10 - year durations . hearings in
sacramento continued on the omnibus new law ( s ) that would give the state
long - term buying authority , and also decide how to handle operation of the
utility hydroelectric generation system and over - market purchased power
contracts with so - called "" qualifying facilities "" ( qfs ) .
bidders , utilities and other market participants expressed initial enthusiasm
for the state ' s new program , with san diego - based sempra ' s ceo telling the
financial community thursday that he is "" encouraged "" by the state auction .
"" we don ' t yet have detailed information on the bids in the first round - - -
and in my opinion that ' s what it is , a first round - - - but from what the
governor has said , i am quite encouraged that we are going to see power
allocated to the three utilities at below the costs that they have recently
been paying in the wholesale power market , "" said sempra ' s stephen baum . "" that
should ease the financial situation of all three utilities and give us
greater liquidity , opening the way to further measures being discussed , such
as securitization of uncollected balances . ""
california ' s governor also pushed ahead on several other fronts , announcing
three new energy - related advisors plucked from the public and private
sectors : mike peevey , a former utility president turned - successful - energy
startup entrepreneur ; s . david freeman , general manager of the nation ' s
largest municipal utility and a veteran of more than four decades in public
power ; and frank zarb , nasdaq stock market ceo and a former top - level energy
adviser in presidents nixon and ford administrations in washington , d . c . in
the 1970 s .
peevey , whose wife was elected to the state legislature in november , will
serve as davis ' s energy adviser ; freeman will help the state water resources
department develop long - term power contracts and zarb will advise davis on
energy finance and market issues .
also on wednesday , davis announced the newly created five - member politically
appointed board for the state - chartered transmission grid operator ( cal - iso )
held its first meeting . it replaces a 26 - member industry stakeholder board
that davis has regularly criticized for representing energy companies rather
than consumers . the new members include close aides to the governor , such as
his business / transportation cabinet - level secretary , head of the state
electricity oversight board , and his senior policy adviser , along with a
veteran consumer group attorney and the chief staff person at the silicon
valley manufacturing group .
a california - based spokesperson for duke , tom williams , confirmed that his
company participated in the auction and that its bids are "" all contingent on
coming to agreeable credit terms . "" reliant also reportedly participated in
the auction .
"" the balls in the state ' s court now , "" williams said . in addition to
announcing it had made "" credible bids "" in the state water resources
department - run electricity auction , duke noted that pre - scheduled outages of
two power plant units to upgrade their air emission controls - - - one each at
moss landing and san diego ' s south bay - - - were nearing completion and would
be back the end of january ( moss ) and march respectively .",ham

"sources report that the bond authorization will be put to a vote today
the bridge loan financing bill will put to a vote today in the california
assembly . the republicans are currently in caucus until 3 : 30 pst and then
will go to the floor for a vote . the current situation is very fluid , but
sources now indicate that the bill would pass with a simple majority vote ,
lacking the two - thirds needed for an immediate bond issuance . if this is the
case , the bill would not take effect for 90 days and the state would be
forced to abandon its proposed bridge loan plans . absent of last minute
financial rescues by davis or a new longer bridge loan package ( unlikely )
socal could seek voluntary bankruptcy . the main problem would then be the
waiting period for financial relief from the state through the transmission
line purchase or other assistance .
there is an outside chance that republican defectors could precipitate from
the current caucus . there is extreme pressure on the republicans from davis
and angelides . if the bill failed due to lack of republican support , it
would provide davis the opportunity to blame republicans for on - going
expenditures of $ 70 m / day ( power purchases ) , and a possible bankruptcy by
socal . the last republican who gave support to a democratic bill ( ab lx ) ,
representative bill campbell , lost his job . sources also confirm that
democrats have not met with republicans on the bond issuance since last week .",ham

nebraska ' s option will blast through attacking defenses
jul 12 , 2000 10 : 12 p . m . et
by darryl richards
foxsports . com
the first national champion of the millennium will not be the product of a
space - age spread offense inspired by a mad scientist who calls himself an
offensive coordinator .
the best college football team in america this season will run the most basic
of offenses . call the option many things : plain , boring , ancient , uninspired .
but when nebraska runs it , it  , s cruel and usual punishment for opposing
defenses .
teams may be able to slow it down , but over the course of four quarters , they
will pay a price , slammed repeatedly by an offensive line that averages 303
pounds . remember the limp noodles crawling out of sun devil stadium in
january ? that was tennessee  , s defense after the cornhuskers drove 99 yards in
the fourth quarter of the fiesta bowl .
the beauty of the system is that it is the perfect offense for the current
rage of defenses using quick , blitzing attacks . sure , you can send everybody
after the ball , but the option demands you stop and think and play an
assignment . how do you properly scout a team that runs an offense you see
only once a year ? the answer is you don  , t .
arguably , the cornhuskers , foxsports . com ' s no . 1 team in its preseason top
25 , were playing the best football in the country by the end of the 1999
season . in their last five games , the cornhuskers beat texas a & m , kansas
state , colorado , texas and tennessee by a cumulative score of 164 - 72 . the
scary thing about nebraska is that 10 offensive starters return for a team
that finished 12 - 1 last season .
the cornhuskers have an unquenchable desire to be the best again . it starts
in the off - season and continues through january . the running game took a
while to materialize last season because of injuries , but i - back dan
alexander and quarterback eric crouch have the ability to rush for 1 , 000
yards this season . even if the oft - injured alexander can  , t hold up to the
pounding , the cornhuskers have a replacement with great credentials and a
fitting name for this smashmouth football team : thunder collins .
nebraska will not only push other teams around . the cornhuskers will push
themselves . the school is touting guard russ hochstein and center dominic
raiola for the outland trophy , presented to the nation ' s outstanding interior
lineman . the beneficiary of this internal competition is the offense .
"" this group has a great deal of confidence that always shows come august and
september , "" said nebraska coach frank solich , who has his best team since
taking over for tom osborne three years ago . "" we have a rich history and a
team coming off a good season that is not questioning things .
"" we have high expectations . some of it comes from how we finished last
season . a lot comes from playing in an excellent program and tradition . ""
the option and the ' huskers are inextricably bound . it is their offense , and
they have been running it so long it is practically an open - book test for
defensive coordinators . yet , only eight teams have passed the test over the
last seven years . nebraska has won 81 games and three national titles in that
span .
"" we try to keep up with what  , s current and we use the spring to experiment , ""
solich said . "" but our players and coaches like to line up and beat you . our
players that are here love it . it is an aggressive style of play and that  , s
how they want to play it . it  , s what our players want to do on offense . ""
the cornhuskers will not go through the season unchallenged . crouch can put
his name up there with the turner gill , tommie frazier and scott frost for
the title of best nebraska quarterback ever , but all bets are off for this
team if crouch is hurt , because the cornhuskers lack depth at quarterback .
the schedule has its pitfalls too . notre dame , looking for a win that can
restore luster and a reason to keep coach bob davie , gets nebraska at home on
sept . 9 . a resurgent oklahoma team and top rival kansas state get nebraska at
their places . kansas state won the last time the teams met in manhattan .
the cornhuskers will probably play texas or oklahoma in the big 12
championship game , which has had a tendency to produce a surprise finish .
the cornhuskers also must shore up a secondary that loses ralph and mike
brown . but nebraska carlos polk back as the heart of the defense . polk is
heralded by nebraska insiders as the best linebacker in school history .
but come january 3 , nebraska will play florida state for the national title .
and the seminoles too will fall under the relentless attack .

reply to : ahmedadams @ tiscali . cz
from : dr . ahmed adams
attn : sir / madam ,
i would like to firstly send to you the best wishes of good health and
success in your pursuits particularly through my proposal as contained
in this letter .
before going into details of my proposal to you , i must first implore
you to treat with the utmost confidentiality as this is required for its
success and to have faith in this transaction , for opportunities like
this only comes to one once in a life time .
my colleagues and i are senior officials of the federal government of my
country ' s contracts review panel ( crp ) who are interested in diverting
some funds that are presently floating in the accounts of the apex bank
of my country . in order to commence this transaction , we solicit for
your assistance to enable us transfer into your nominated account the
said floating funds .
the source of the funds are as follows : during the last military regime
in my country , government officials set up companies and awarded
themselves contracts that were grossly over - invoiced in various
ministries and parastatals . the present civilian government set up the
contract review panel , which has the mandate to use the instruments of
payments made available to it by the decree setting up the panel , to
review these contracts and if necessary pay those who are being owed
outstanding amounts .
my colleagues and i have identified quite a huge sum of these funds ,
which are presently floating in our ( apex ) central bank , ready for
disbursement and would like to divert some of it for our own purposes .
however , by virtue of our positions as civil servants and members of
this panel , we cannot acquire these funds in our names or in the names
of companies that are based in my country . i have therefore been
mandated , as a matter of trust by my colleagues in the panel , to look
for a reliable overseas partner into whose account we can transfer the
sum of u . s . $ 20 , 500 , 000 . 00 ( twenty million , five hundred thousand u . s .
dollars ) . that is why i am seeking your assistance . we have agreed to
share the money to be transferred into your account , if you agree with
our proposition as follows ;
( i ) 25 % to the account owner ( you ) .
( ii ) 65 % for us ( the panel officials ) .
( iii ) 10 % to be used in settling all expenses ( by
both you and us ) incidental to the actualization of this project .
we wish to invest our share of the proceeds of this project in foreign
stock markets and other viable business till we are ready and able to
have access to them without raising any eyebrows here at home . please
note that this transaction is 100 % safe and risk - free . we intend to
effect the transfer within ten ( 10 ) banking days from the date of
receipt of the following information through the fax number stated
above : your company ' s name , address , telephone and fax numbers ; we will
use your company ' s name to apply for the payment and backdate the award
of the contract in favour of your company . we are looking forward to
doing this transaction with you and we solicit for your utmost
confidentiality in this transaction .
i will bring you into a more detailed picture of this transaction when
i hear from you . please get in touch through my email address
above .
best regards ,
dr . ahmed adams

john ,
i talked with dave . in addition to his original list we have agreed to the following .
primary metals - ok
refining - ok
grain and meat processing - too broad . baughman should pursue deals but this category includes lots of small retail load . dave will think of solution .
cement - ok
auto - ok on big 3 , not the parts suppliers
aerospace - no - ees has global outsourcing with boeing and lockheed martin ( the two biggest )
paper manufacturing - includes all forest products - ok
glass - no - they have outsourcing with the largest companies already
in general , this seems reasonable , subject to middle - ground on dealing with agricultural processors . fyi baughman is negotiating with archer daniels midland re a 300 mw high load factor grain processing load and luce has several deals with meat and grain processors .

john ,
i surveyed the group . in general , people are fine but we should ask for a bit more . this should apply to us only as milnthorp has already cut a separate deal with janet .
ees proposed that they own all sic codes except the following :
mining
oil and gas extraction
paper manufacturing
chemical manufacturing
petroleum and coal manufacturing
plastics and rubber products manufacturing
fertilizer industry
rail transportation
in our discussion with dave , we suggested and he agreed that primary metals should be added
in discussions with the different regions :
ena should add :
refining
grain processing - baughman and luce
meat processing - luce
cement manufacturing - luce
auto manufacturing - luce , baughman
aerospace manufacturing - tycholiz , baughman
heavy industrial equipment manufacturing ( caterpillar , john deere ) - baughman
paper manufacturing should include - pulp , board , lumber , etc .
glass manufacturing - luce ( i suspect dave will resist this because of their owens corning deals )
let me know if there is anything else i should do .

subject : canadian outsourcing deals
i met with peggy hedstrom and to some extent with laura scott in calgary regarding how they handle the day to day activity of their producer outsourcing deals .
the producer provides to ec their projected production schedule for the year by month by plant outlet . this information is entered into sitara by ec on a single ticket with no meter information . for the prompt month ec confirms back to the producer their expected production volumes by point by day . this includes any maintenance or scheduled down time that would affect their daily flows . this information is contained within a excel spreadsheet which can be viewed by the producer via a common network drive .
the producer communicates to ec their sales for the month and on a daily basis . ec enters these trades in sitara . the sitara position by producer is balanced to zero daily . the producer does not have access to sitara .
ec acts as agent for the downstream transportation owned by producer . they have no diversion rights on this transport , it is utilised at the direction of the producer . ec nominates producers transport . all transport expense estimates are maintained by ec . ec is invoiced and pays the pipeline .
ec monitors estimated hourly flows from the plant outlets as provided by nova . it is the responsibility of ec to inform the producer of significant variances in their scheduled versus estimated flows . nova requires that shippers be balanced on a daily basis or face penalties if variances are out of tolerance . it is ec ' s responsibility to keep the producer out of penalty situations . the producer , at the direction of ec , either sells or buys on an intraday basis to balance their position on the pipeline . final estimated flows are then downloaded by ec into the excel spreadsheet . this final estimate is than used as the expected volume for the upcoming day . and sitara is updated accordingly .
at months end the spreadsheet information is transferred to an accounting system referred to as solomon . actual volumes as provided by the pipeline are also entered into the system for settlement . i didn ' t have a lot of time to devote to the accounting process , but i doubt ena would take this approach .
ec utilises a single point of contact with each producer from a logistics and origination standpoint . peggy said they did not hire people specifically from the producer / customers but did seek out people with extensive producer experience to assist with these customers . peggy feels that their success is due in a large part to the very strong relationships they have developed with their customers through this point of contact approach .
it is of note that unify is not utilised in managing these customers business . peggy feels that unify is not designed to handle it and response time is too slow for their purposes given the time constraints they are working under on a daily basis .",ham

sequoia interests
trading symbol sqnc pk
what if a company had a product that would allow oil wells to
produce much more oil ?
what would that stock be worth with todays oil prices close to 50
usd per barrel ?
10 , 20 , 30 , 100 usd ? and now several of the major oil companies are
currently testing the product .
at 0 . 50 we think sqnc is a homerun .
to solve this problem , the oil industry is looking for new
alternatives for increased exploration and production . the clear
solution for increased demand and consumption can already be found
in the ground , with nearly two thirds of oil left in the ground at
us wells , too technically complex or expensive to extract with
traditional technologies . enhanced oil recovery , eor , is an exciting
new frontier in the oil and gas industry which you are going to hear
more of in the coming years . sqncs innovative new product ,
diamondflo , could be at the forefront of this frontier .
sqnc has strong interest from major oil and gas companies for
testing and potential licensing of this product , and is in the final
stages of the research and development of diamondflo . with testing
expected to be completed in the next 60 to 90 days , and planned
patent application shortly thereafter , announcements from sqnc could
cause price gains for this stock over the coming months . what is
more , diamondflos unique chemical properties , make it an ideal
solution for a number of other application in the oil and gas
industry , including remediation and environmental cleanup of oil
fields , refineries , and storage facilities ; an estimated 8 . 1 billion
market . with this revolutionary product in the development pipeline ,
sqnc has also made some aggressive moves into oil and gas production
with its recent acquisition of leases in pecos valley , texas . these
operations will act as a testbed for development and validation of
the diamondflo product and could provide an additional revenue
stream and source of cash flow for sqnc .
with the commercialization of its diamondflo product looming near ,
we feel that it is only a matter of time before wall street
recognizes this stock . what is more , sqnc is positioned within an
industry that has seen tremendous upside growth , and is headed for
even more appreciation as the global oil crisis demands new
production solutions . over the last twelve months , the oil well
services and equipment industry has seen an average price gain of
more than 88 percent , and savvy investors in emerging companies have
witnessed tremendous profits . we believe that sqnc is one of the
most revolutionary new companies on the market . with major
announcements stemming from the completion of r and d on diamondflo ,
do you think sqnc could make a nice move in the coming day ? .
a few reasons to own sqnc .
1 . with its innovative diamondflo product , sqnc is positioned to
help alleviate the impending oil and gas crisis , with producers
struggling to keep up with growing us energy demands , as foreign
exploration and production comes under increasing geopolitical
pressures . increased consumption demands have combined with an
increasingly unstable international production climate to create
some of the highest prices seen at the pump since the 1970 s oil
embargo , and crude oil prices on the spot market have recently
approached the 50 usd mark . as oil companies seek new ways to
maximize domestic oil recovery , the chemical eor approach of sqnc
will be a major factor in increasing production and removing
dependence on foreign oil .
2 . enhanced oil recovery , eor , represents the logical next step in
expanding domestic oil production , and represents a tremendous and
presently underappreciated market potential . over two thirds of oil
in us reservoirs is left unproduced after primary and secondary
production , leaving an incredible and untapped source for us energy
needs . according to the us department of energy , eor has the
potential to recover 35 billion barrels of oil , 50 percent more than
the current us proven reserves of 23 billion barrels , and even
greater than the us estimated undiscovered potential of 30 billion
barrels . with its diamondflo chemical eor solution , sqnc could be
ideally positioned to benefit from a renewed focus on production
from these untapped oil reserves .
3 . sqnc has developed a revolutionary chemical eor product ,
diamondflo which offers tremendous advantages over thermal and gas
eor methods . thermal and gas , primarily co 2 injection to stimulate
production are costly and require a complex infrastructure , while
other chemical eor products have had limited success and are
environmentally damaging . by contrast , diamondflo is expected to
generate recovery of 20 to 40 percent above current methods , is
environmentally safe and meets strict regulatory standards for oil
recovery and remediation , and will be available to producers at a
comparable price point to competitive products . with introduction of
diamondflo to the market following completion of testing and
development , sqnc could revolutionize the oil and gas industry with
this innovative approach to enhanced oil recovery .
4 . in addition to its principal application in eor , sqncs diamondflo
product has additional applications in the 8 . 1 billion oil and gas
remediation market . during the testing process , diamondflo has
demonstrated exceptional remediation properties , with static
remediation tests determining that it removed more than 80 percent
of hydrocarbons from soil with no significant hydrocarbon emulsion ,
mixing of oil and water . this discovery paves the way for eventual
application in environmental cleanup of oil facilities or spills ,
and opens up a tremendous new market for sqnc . since 1992 , the

quest oil ' s mission is to deliver a competitive and sustainable rate of
return for
our shareholders by acquiring , exploring and developing oil and gas
properties around the world .
now that oil and gas has entered a | ong - term bul | market ,
our speciaity in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
undervalued energy piays has produced soaring returns .
quest oil corporation ( qoil ) hastargeted oi | and gas exploration in
both north america and
internationaliy . the company is focused on acquiring quality oi | and
gas properties in
regions that provide economicaliy and poiitica | | y stable environments .
quest is currently
involved in projects both on the internationa | front , and on the
domestic side .
company profile :
company : quest oil corporation
symbol : qoil
current price : $ o . 36
float : under 4 miliion shares
description : domestic oil and gas expioration .
how much it wil | up again ? 2 times ? 3 or more . . ?
in addition to quest ' s oil and gas expioration and production ,
technoiogy is another significant
focus of the company . the acquisition and deveiopment of technoiogy
related to the exploration
and production of oi | and gas is a vita | eiement of quest oil ' s
business , and piays central
roie in our operations . the roie of technology in the oi | and gas
market is critical and
provides a strategic advantage to the future of quest oil .
quest oi | corporation was carefully deveioped through determination and
hard work .
by evaluating our risks , and maintaining a strict ethica | standard . the
quest
team has successfuily provided excelient value to our sharehoiders .
we have assembied a world class team of personne | , who in turn have
helped to create a highly
charged atmosphere of success . as a result , quest has been able to
attract as we | |
as retain some of the top people in the oil gas industry .
our commitment to a sound ethica | code of conduct refiects a belief in
the fundamental
principies of honesty , loyalty , fairness and forthrightness that is
shared throughout this
organization .
aiready shares in the oi | and gas sector are rising faster than the
overal | market . in fact , four of dow jones ' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy related . but it ' s in the mid - sized
explorers and developers | ike ( qoil ) that the biggest gains are
being made . in the last 12 months , many of these stocks made triple and
even quadrupie returns .
our subscribers need to pay particuiariy ciose attention to undervalued
qoil shares , because it won ' t be a bargain for long . this smal | company
with a comparably sma | | market value , is sitting on a bonanza of oil
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especialiy with
the daily jump in energy prices .
but al | that wil | change in a few short weeks , as these reserves move
into production , bringing an expiosion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market , and have an equa | | y explosive
effect on the share price .
what wil | the cash fiow from these projects do for the price of quest
oil
s ' shares ? weil we do know this - the great thing about
investing in qoil is that your gains don ' t depend on further increases
in the price of oil and gas . even if energy prices stay flat , or deciine
slightly , you wiil stil | make a very healthy return . of course , energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or so as predicted , meaning the vaiue of qoi | ' s assets and earnings wil |
soar even higher . in that case , the reward for investors will be
staggering .
overa | | , we consider qoil to be one of the | ast outstanding energy
piays in the oil and gas sector . once this discovery has been reaiized ,
qoil shares wiil surge sharply on heavy investor attention . we have
identified this discovery for immediate accumuiation . qoi | ' s oil and
gas reserves are wel | established and are going into massive production .
eariy investors wi | | secure optimum gains , and any additiona | news in
this
area will realiy turn up the heat , causing us to revise our targets
upward in next week ' s builetin .

"greg ,
two things i did not manage to mention to you at the meeting on monday .
1 . joe carson . i was very positively impressed by joe carson .
enron badly needs a senior economist of his stature and
experience . he has many contacts in the industry and can represent
enron well . he is very pragmatic and , also , i expect a cool head on old
shoulders .
one negative is that he wants to work out of new york . the tradeoff is
between
maintaining his contacts and working closer with the desks .
2 . tony mends . i think you , or louise , should explore the possibility of
using the skills of tony mends .
tony and i are good friends so i may be biased . i think that he is a very
smart
and efficient person and can contribute a lot to the organization that
relies
on processing huge volumes of information .

"faith :
here is a spreadsheet that summarizes the individual contributions for west power middle market and west power services . a couple thoughts :
- please make sure the dollars are distributed to the individuals so credit is given where credit is due . although i wish i made the money currently indicated in the tables , obviously the numbers represent the total for all of us .
- services desk p & l is the responsibility of greg wolfe and he is a leading originator for the coverage group . the attached table reflects the sum of both groups .
- some of the contributors to middle market west power are non - commercial ( cocke , rawson ) while others are not technically in the middle market group although the p 2 ) number of transactions ; 3 ) number of different counter parties transacting ; and 4 ) number of eol clients brought in . quantifying these few items should be relatively simple and go a long way toward measuring coverage .
we currently measure these coverage metrics and it is my understanding that other middle marketing groups do as well . it should be relatively simple to begin assimilating this data and including it in the data you are collecting for all of ena middle market .
perhaps non - middle market origination groups can measure certain behaviors as well .
let me know if you have any questions .
thanks !

paula corey has informed that the it people say it would be impossible to delete all prior trade data from "" to be netco "" employees '

existing e - mail
home directory
the recommendation is to wipe these clean prior to netco employees obtaining access to them . further , the recommendation was made that people not be warned to avoid cheating . i do not know if not telling people is fair . however , absent some other solution , it would appear that deleting this information would be advisable . would you be the person to instruct the it people to delete and / or announce to "" to be netco "" employees that this will occur ?

"guys , attached you will find a final cut on the ena 2001 expense budget .
please review and make any adjustments to your existing plan that are
appropriate to hit the net ena target . in order to stay flat year on year , i
split the remaining positive variance equally across the groups . as we had
discussed earlier , these costs will not be allocated to the business units
and will be tracked on the ena income statement below the line and the
accountability managed by each of you . all outside variable costs ,
specifically related to specific deals , will be charged to the business units
eg ) outside legal and tax , outside technical expertise , facility costs ,
outside research support , incremental back and mid office support for
specific asset management deals , specific entertainment , etc . i look at this
cost structure as the minimum capacity charge we need to operate our business
and evaluate / manage our risks .
wes , can you please finalize the one page plan ( expenses and headcount ) for
each group with these changes .
regards

ambition should be made of sterner stuff .
real courage is when you know you ' re licked before you begin , but you begin anyway and see it through no matter what . the most important part of teaching is to teach what it is to know .
when it comes to finances , remember that there are no withholding taxes on the wages of sin . god proved his love on the cross . when christ hung , and bled , and died , it was god saying to the world , ' ' i love you . ' ' to be human means to feel inferior .
what ' s more enchanting than the voices of young people , when you can ' t hear what they say ? when a nation is filled with strife , then do patriots flourish .
blessed is the man who finds out which way god is moving and then gets going in the same direction . we give advice , but we cannot give the wisdom to profit by it .
those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love : it is the faithless who know love ' s tragedies .
the due process of law as we use it , i believe , rests squarely on the liberal idea of conflict and resolution . our farmers round , well pleased with constant gain , like other farmers , flourish and complain . it is a melancholy truth that even great men have their poor relations .
here ' s the rule for bargains : ' ' do other men , for they would do you . ' ' that ' s the true business precept . death is a shadow that always follows the body . in the arts , the critic is the only independent source of information . the rest is advertising .

"per our conversation , here is the model that i have for simon . the notes
that i gave you were from some work i did back in september as i was looking
for volume numbers . the notes show what drives the final cash flow numbers .
briefly , the issue surrounds exactly what is meant by nonmarket and
noncredit risk . ideally , this would be anything that effects npv of the
deal . however , i think that we should limit ourselves to those things that
effect the time and amount of the eam volumes . even here , such a problem set
is quite large . if you glance at the spreadsheet model , you will notice that
there exists a large number of possible items that effect the eam volumes .
if we are to do this rigorously , then it is necessary to tear apart ees ' s
business model , and although such an attempt to do so would be noble , the
scope of such an excercise may be too large . we need a clear definition of
ees operational risk .
briefly , from the ees deals that i have looked at , two things drive their
profit : a long term bet that power prices will go down , and that we can
improve the facility through various enhancements . each of these may be
gleaned from the spreadsheet , as well as the assumptions regarding the
funding of the facility improvements and so on . 95 % of the savings is
assumed to come from power , and 5 % from gas . ( the effeciency gain may not be
explicitly given ) . if we have data that show the realized efficiency gains ,
then it would be simple [ in principle ] to determine a distribution , and hence
a distribution of eam volumes , npv ' s , etc . at this time , i understand that
rac has determined some of the realized efficiency gains , but my knowledge is
quite sketchy . jay hachen may have more info .
if i get a chance , i will try to see if i can do a "" proof of concept ""
excercise , but i have a late january deadline on something else .
another point : even if we are successful in doing this for the spreadsheet
model , ees has chosen to book things differently . i do not have a thorough
understanding of their it systems , but at least in principle , if we can do
this for the spreadsheet model , then we can do it in their it environment
( data are data are data ) . they may book efficiency gains through improvement
type , such as gains due to compressors , chillers , boilers , etc . if this is
indeed the case , then we need to have distributions for each type of
improvement .
if we are successful on the spreadsheet and not successful with their it
systems , then the other alternative is to build our own reporting system . it
would be similar to a database where the recordsets are replaced by excel
workbooks . it can be constructed in such a way as to enable us to run
simulations and queries , but this would probably take me about five or six
weeks .
finally , don hawkins does operational audits for enron ' s physical assets .
he sends out teams to audit our pipelines and strategic assets . i don ' t
think that he does it for ees , but you might want to give him a call anyway .

subject : further actions on anjam ' s departure
hi mel
further to our earlier discussions here ' s the full list of actions we ' d like
to put into place regarding anjam ' s departure :
hr - type stuff :
1 . get anjam off the trading floor as soon as possible . there is no need for
him to remain on the floor . this will need to be delayed until it number 1
is completed ( cataloguing his work ) .
2 . determine where anjam is heading . we need to know who is going to know
our positions and curves next .
3 . remove his security pass , and insist that he is always accompanied when in
the building . sharad is to sit with him while he catalogues his work .
it - type stuff :
1 . ask him to catalogue the contents of his h : drive , since the rest of the
group will need to support his work in the future . this should take no more
than a day or two .
2 . get it to obtain their backups of anjam ' s h : drive for weekly intervals
over the last two months . this will allow us to determine what he has
deleted .
3 . get it to provide a snapshot of anjam ' s notes folders , and provide records
of mail sent out to the internet over the last couple of months . i ' m worried
about code / data he may have zipped up and mailed out .
4 . ask it to use a utility program to determine what has been deleted from
anjam ' s c : drives . there may be useful info here too .
5 . revoke all internet access , whether via explorer or notes mail .
6 . get a record of all files he has printed over the last couple of months .
vince has ok ' d this lot , so let ' s do it asap .
many thanks ,
steve",ham

"below is a brief summary of the main issues regarding direct access . we will continue to the follow the progress and keep you updated .
summary :
direct access was designed to break utility monopolies and was a key component of california ' s 1996 deregulation law . under this concept , all customers could directly access an energy provider other than their regulated utility . the debate over direct access is at the heart of a complicated attempt to solve california ' s costly power crisis . it will determine whether businesses , with residential customers , pay for the bulk of the state ' s future energy purchases . it also could determine whether southern california edison , the state ' s cash - strapped no . 2 utility , will avoid bankruptcy , and whether deregulation will survive in any form .
big businesses , free - market advocates and alternative energy providers have lobbied state legislators to find a way to keep so - called "" direct access "" . now , as the state prepares to sell $ 13 . 4 billion in bonds to begin paying off its debt , legislators and energy officials say they must prevent big businesses from wiggling out of that obligation by closing off their direct - access escape route . regulators are concerned that if businesses flee the system , the state will be stuck with too much electricity under long - term electricity contracts through 2021 . that would mean residential ratepayers would be stuck paying the bulk of the $ 43 billion in future power costs , a point that has enraged consumer groups . currently , only about 88 , 000 customers buy their energy through direct access ( per cec statistics ) , including about 10 , 000 large commercial / industrial customers , and about 78 , 000 residences . alternative service providers shifted most of their customers back to california ' s primary utility suppliers ( socal ed . , pg & e , sdg & e ) earlier this year when prices skyrocketed and they could no longer compete with utility rates capped by the legislature .
california legislators argue that direct access is the keystone of the latest edison bailout plan , sponsored by assembly speaker pro tem fred keeley . under the plan , the 3 , 600 largest businesses would agree to pay $ 3 . 1 billion of edison ' s debts over 15 years . in exchange , businesses would be allowed to secure their own power contracts by 2003 , but not without first paying an "" exit fee . "" the fees and which parties would be exempt remain undetermined , however , they would include a surcharge or a complicated calculation in which businesses would pay a percentage of future energy purchases . it is likely that whatever compromise legislators are able to reach regarding direct access , california ' s business community will have extreme difficulty accepting the terms .
to ensure their efforts at resolving the direct access dilemma and abate fears of a collapsing state budget , lawmakers have gone so far as to introduce two bills , ( one sponsored by sen . bowen and defeated in july , and a second by assemblyman dave kelley , ) that would rescind language in previous legislation that authorized the public utilities commission to block direct access . the california puc has thus far stayed a decision on the matter , but is expected to rule by august 23 rd .
complicating the issue is wall street . the state ' s bankers , led by j . p morgan , are nervous about selling as much as $ 13 . 4 billion in planned state bonds if businesses ( currently the largest ratepayers in the state , after governments ) find a way out of the system . the bonds are meant to repay the state for $ 8 . 2 billion in power - buying costs so far this year and to cover some future costs . business and residential electricity customers would repay the bonds through a surcharge on their utility bills . if businesses were allowed to sign on with outside energy providers , that revenue stream would be in jeopardy .",ham

enron paid out ' retention ' bonuses before bankruptcy filing
december 6 , 2001
by richard a . oppel jr . and kurt eichenwald
just days before enron ( news / quote ) filed for bankruptcy
and laid off 4 , 000 people , it paid out $ 55 million in
bonuses to about 500 employees , according to several people
who had dealings with the company .
yesterday evening , an enron spokesman confirmed the
bonuses , describing them as "" retention incentives "" for
crucial employees . bankruptcy experts said that the
payments were almost certain to be closely scrutinized -
and probably challenged - by enron ' s creditors .
separately , the labor department said yesterday that it had
opened an investigation into how enron managed its
employees ' 401 ( k ) retirement plans . those accounts were
heavily invested in enron shares , and company rules
prohibited many employees from diversifying their holdings .
the labor department said that employees had lost up to 90
percent of the value of their accounts .
"" enron ' s employees have gotten the short end of the stick
in the sudden collapse of this company , "" said labor
secretary elaine l . chao . enron has said that a temporary
freeze that kept some employees from shifting retirement
investments was long planned and allowed another company to
take over the job of administering the plan .
enron declined to say how much was paid out in bonuses , who
received the money or what the range of payments was .
executives of companies entering bankruptcy defend such
payments as necessary if there is to be any hope of
reorganizing as a going concern . but they often prove to be
incendiary . for example , in 1990 , when it was disclosed
that drexel burnham lambert had paid key executives some
$ 250 million in bonuses before filing for bankruptcy ,
creditors and the government reacted with outrage . in the
end , after court hearings on the issue , the drexel estate
sued the employees to get the money back .
the payments by enron "" are substantially high , and that
means it probably does become an issue in the bankruptcy
case , "" said james feder , a bankruptcy lawyer with feder &
mills , a law firm in los angeles . "" the question might come
up as to whether there was fair consideration given for the
amount of these bonuses and whether they were reasonable
under the circumstances . ""
if creditors can convince the court that the employees were
overpaid - or that the payments were made to keep money out
of creditors ' hands , a much more difficult argument to
prove - then the judge can void the payments and order the
money returned , said lynn lopucki , a law professor at the
university of california at los angeles .
to tamp down such disputes , a company typically will file a
request , as part of its bankruptcy filing , to make payments
to certain employees , and not proceed with the payments
until receiving a judge ' s approval , mr . lopucki said .
yesterday , mark palmer , an enron spokesman , defended the
payments as necessary "" in order to protect and maintain the
value of the estate . "" such payments "" are done in every
bankruptcy , "" he said , adding that the payments were made to
employees "" at all levels of the organization . ""
employees who lost their jobs after enron filed for
bankruptcy protection on sunday were told they may receive
no more than $ 4 , 500 in severance pay . they also were told
to petition the bankruptcy court to cash in unused vacation
days .
in another legal slap at enron , a shareholder lawsuit filed
late tuesday accused 29 enron officers and directors of
engaging in "" massive insider trading "" and making "" false and
misleading "" statements about the company ' s financial
performance while selling about $ 1 . 1 billion worth of stock
over the last three years .
an enron spokesman declined to comment on the suit , which
was filed by amalgamated bank , which is known to be an
activist shareholder .

mark at 27 months looked ? normal ? . he came from a good family who provided lots of stimulation . mark had one word - - ' ba ' as in ' ball . ' everything was ' ba . ' after a few days of orientation in the classroom , i presented the computer . the first day he sat at the computer for 20 minutes and pressed the ball , bus , bee on the intellikeys keyboard over and over again . he then looked at me and pointed to the ball and said ? ba ? then he pointed to the bee and said ' be ' and the bus and said ' bu . ' i was astonished and his mother started to cry .
brian was a boy with down ' s syndrome . he was taking several medications . brian came from a nurturing family and extended family who provided him with every opportunity . his mother was a teacher and wanted what was best for him . he exhibited no language and was considerably behind his other friends with down ? s syndrome . we set up a noun program at school . at first he seemed disinterested . he looked at the pictures and sucked his thumb . the more we encouraged him to engage the keyboard , the more he sucked his thumb . we then paired him with a child who was very interested in the noun program . suddenly the two were fighting over who was next to pick a picture . he worked several times a week at the computer . at his 3 - year iep , the team shook their heads . they didn ' t understand . despite the track record of many students with down ? s syndrome , brian ' s language was his best skill . i smiled and his mother winked at me .

given the practitioner audience , i would prefer a less technical
presentation . perhaps if you can talk about use of real options at enron in
general , and then give some examples ( graphically - - no notation ) of
diagrammatic representation might be good . remember there are many talks
and the capacity of the audience to absorb notation , grammar , and technical
detail is limited .
how about a more generic title "" real options at enron ? ""
please give me your title within enron please

the idea of strictly minding our own business is moldy rubbish . who could be so selfish ? your friend is your field which you sow with love and reap with thanksgiving .
sometimes i wish i weren ' t famous . the purpose of life is to be defeated by greater and greater things
happiness is a ball after which we run wherever it rolls , and we push it with our feet when it stops .
foolishness is bound in the heart of a child but the rod of correction shall drive it far from him . [ proverbs 22 : 15 ]
my mother loved children - - she would have given anything if i had been one .
holiness , not happiness , is the chief end of man .
i did send to you for certain sums of gold , which you denied me . i ' m comfortable being old . . . being black . . . being jewish .
life ' s enchanted cup sparkles near the brim .
in every pang that rends the heart the man of sorrows has a part .
by asking for the impossible we obtain the best possible . where thou art , that is home .
the best ballplayer ' s the one who doesn ' t think he made good . he keeps trying to convince you .
the surrounding that householders crave are glorified autobiographies .
business conventions are important because they demonstrate how many people a company can operate without .
to know the will of god is the greatest knowledge ! to do the will of god is the greatest achievement .

"it is with regret that i have to announce that jeff skilling is leaving enron . today , the board of directors accepted his resignation as president and ceo of enron . jeff is resigning for personal reasons and his decision is voluntary . i regret his decision , but i accept and understand it . i have worked closely with jeff for more than 15 years , including 11 here at enron , and have had few , if any , professional relationships that i value more . i am pleased to say that he has agreed to enter into a consulting arrangement with the company to advise me and the board of directors .
now it ' s time to look forward .
with jeff leaving , the board has asked me to resume the responsibilities of president and ceo in addition to my role as chairman of the board . i have agreed . i want to assure you that i have never felt better about the prospects for the company . all of you know that our stock price has suffered substantially over the last few months . one of my top priorities will be to restore a significant amount of the stock value we have lost as soon as possible . our performance has never been stronger ; our business model has never been more robust ; our growth has never been more certain ; and most importantly , we have never had a better nor deeper pool of talent throughout the company . we have the finest organization in american business today . together , we will make enron the world ' s leading company .
on thursday at 10 : 00 a . m . houston time , we will hold an all employee meeting at the hyatt . we will broadcast the meeting to our employees around the world where technically available , and i look forward to seeing many of you there .",ham

if the opportunity presents itself at the energy forum , i would appreciate any discussion of the intrastate pipeline market . specifically , the benefits of price transparency and liquidity on the intrastate pipelines to ensure efficient movement of gas to end users . this will become more of a factor with greater instantaneous gas demand due to the dispatch of gas - fired generation .

"we are not done . on friday when we were prepared to sign , black hills energy capital said they needed until today to get a signature from their parent , black hills corp . at noon today they said that the signature was on its way . at 4 : 00 pm we heard that they will issue a l / c instead of the corp guarantee . the l / c approach is fine , but i am concerned with this flaky behavior .
our plan is to sign the purchase and sale with black hills energy capital tonight / tomorrow morning . they would have the obligation to deliver either a gurantee or an l / c for $ 15 mm by thursday . if not , we can terminate at any time prior to close of business monday . i will update when something changes .

please advise lisa that our expectation is that each business unit will
largely have the final say in establishing office space standards for their
workforce ( as is the case today ) .
corporate may intercede only to the point that a business unit fails to
design to a sufficient density ( average sq . ft . per workplace ) and does not
meet minimum . hard policy has not been set but we expect to gain consensus
from enron ' s executive committee before detailed space planning begins .

"dear friend ,
as you read this , i don ' t want you to feel sorry for me , because , i
believe everyone will die someday . my name is ahmed raheem , a
merchant in dubai , in the u . a . e . i have been diagnosed with lung cancer .
it has defiled all forms of medical treatment , and right now i have
onlyabout
a few months to live , according to medical experts . i have not
particularly lived my life so well , as never really cared for anyone ( not
even myself ) but my business . though i am very rich , i was never generous ,
i was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that
was
the onlything i cared for .
but now i regret all this as now know that there is more to life than
just
wanting to have or make all the money in the world . i believe when god
gives
me a second chance to come to this world i would live my life a
different
way from how i have lived it . now that god has called me , i have willed
and
given most of my
property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well
as a few close friends . i want god to be merciful to me and accept my
soul
so , i have decided to give alms to charity organizations , as i want this
to be one of the last good deeds i do on earth . so far , i have
distributed
money to some charity organizations in the u . a . e , algeria and malaysia .
now that my health has deteriorated so badly , i cannot do this myself
anymore .
i once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and
distribute
the money which i have
there to charity organization in bulgaria and pakistan ; they refused
and kept the money to themselves .
hence , i do not trust them anymore , as they seem not
to be contended with what i have left for them . the last of my money ,
which no one knows of , is the cash deposit of ten million five
hundredus dollarus ( $ 10 , 500 , 000 ) ,
that i have with a security company abroad .
acknowledge this mail so that i can introduce you to my lawyer who will
handle the transfer of receivership by you of the said funds .
i will want you to help me collect this deposit
cash and use it for charity organizations only .
thanks .
god be with you

short term target price : $ o . 5 o
12 month target price : $ 4 . oo

c o m p a n y o v e r v i e w
vinoble , inc . ( vnbl . ob ) is a holding company , which is identifying and
acquiring operational business opportunities in the areas of homeland
security , security information systems , and other security services to
provide long term growth for its shareholders .
vinoble believes that the opportunity to build a successful business in
the security sector is unprecedented .
the terror attacks on the united states on september 11 , 2001 have
changed the security landscape for the foreseeable future . both
physical
and logical security have become paramount for all industry segments ,
especially in the banking , healthcare and government sectors . while the
focus for vinoble is on north america , the opportunity for security
services is worldwide . according to giga , a wholly owned subsidiary of
forrester research , worldwide demand for information security products
and
services is set to eclipse $ 46 b by 2005 .
vinoble intends to capitalize on the dramatic growth in the security
market by delivering professional services , security products , security
training , and managed security services . in pursuit of this objective ,
vinoble has assembled a highly qualified team of security professionals
offering a full range of security services . through vinoble ' s
consulting services and integrated delivery solutions , vinoble will
help
organizations protect key assets including persons , property ,
information ,
brand , and reputation .
homeland security , the national strategy for a secure cyberspace , the
healthcare insurance portability and accountability act ( hipaa ) ,
sarbanes - oxley and other regulatory programs will all cause a continued
increase in security demands in the united states and abroad . vinoble
intends
to position itself as the ' most desired ' provider of , both , physical
and information security solutions - in the eyes of our clients ,
alliance
partners , and peers . we will accomplish this by ensuring our teams are
the most knowledgeable , agile , professional , and cost - conscious
provider of ' tailored ' security solutions to meet the unique needs of
each
client .
management has partnered with garcyco capital corp . ( "" gccc "" ) to assist
in finding acquisition candidates for the company , structuring such
acquisitions , and effecting a transition to corporate growth . at
present ,
vinoble and gccc have targeted several companies as potential
acquisition candidates . pending the outcome of due diligence and
audits , the
company believes the acquisition of these assets will provide the basis
required for listing on a national exchange .
here is recent news on the company :
malibu , calif . - - ( business wire ) - - may 20 , 20 o 5 - - vinoble , inc . ( otcbb :
vnbl - news ) , a holding company seeking to identify long - term growth
opportunities in the areas of homeland security , security information
systems , and other security services , is pleased to announce that as it
continues in its efforts to reach definitive agreements on the acquisition
of assets , businesses , and strategic partners in the rfid and gps
tracking sector , vinoble has further engaged with several additional
businesses and individuals for the purpose of acquiring technology , software ,
and patents .
following the move to acquire rfid ( radio frequency identification )
technology , hardware and patents for the sole purpose of specific use
applications , the company has concluded that the need for application
support software or middleware is part of the fundamental component of the
framework which operates such technology . the company has identified
several sources for both licensing and the acquisition of such software ,
and has begun to pursue discussions to access this important element .
middleware is used primarily to link disparate applications , both
internally and externally , to the enterprise . this typically involves
routing data using different transport protocols , translating data into
different formats and providing a suitable means of integration such as web
services and service - oriented architectures .
since rfid is an integral part in the tracking of both mobile and
non - mobile assets , user - friendly and efficient management software enabling
customers to manage rfid data both incoming and out - bound is important
in maintaining customer loyalty and reduces costs associated with
customer service . management software will allow for real time visibility of
assets or product inventory , whether in transit , in a warehouse , at the
manufacturing plant , or on a store shelf . visibility and accuracy will
enable customers to reduce handling costs , gain instant access to
shipment information and increase inventory flow throughout the supply
chain . the ability to manage data collection from a number of different rfid
and gps devices is essential for proper efficiency of the system .
the company believes that such acquisition of middleware technology
will be essential and will further position vinoble in the vastly growing
rfid and gps tracking industry . the company ' s goal is to provide
critical security services at a cost manageable to even the smallest of
businesses that can ' t afford to do without the safety of their personnel and
assets in this current state of constant threat .

a few more details . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . again , most of the ega companies ' ownership trail includes all enron ownership through a number of enron entities . through further research , we found a few more that don ' t totally fit that mold :
elektro - electricidad e servicos s . a . in brazil . . . . 38 % of this company if publicly held with the remainder held by enron entities .
epe - empresa productora de energia ltda in brazil has outside owners including shell and ljm brazilco and interjuris s / c ltda . a . k . a . shell cuiaba holdings owns two shares and has a 1 % direct ownership interest and one board vote .
energia ltd , another brazil operation , is owned by enbras which in turn in owned by enron corp . ( shares of the company are pledged to westdeusche landesbank gironzentrale as of 22 feb . 01 .
again , this may be more information than you ever wanted or needed but thought you might like to know .

steve :
as stated earlier , many of the company names on the list that was provided either do not exactly match what we have in corporate records or there is such a long list with very similar names that we have just made assumptions in most cases regarding ownership .
we can assure you that , for the most part , you have placed the companies in the correct business bucket ( i . e . , corp . , ena , ees , etc . ) . there are a few , however , that may be incorrectly categorized , as follows :
ea : ect non u . s . payroll company ( there is no such entity , but i would assume these folks are paid by ena )
enron capital & trade resources in london , uk ( may actually be enron europe company called enron capital & trade resources limited )
ebs : broadband solutions pvt . ltd . ( actually comes up to corp . through a long complicated chain of companies associated with atlantic commercial finance )
eeos : enron engineering & construction and the former nepco are both organized under eeso whose ownership remains enron corp .
the nepco in the uk could actually be nepco europe ltd . whose ownership is tied to enron europe .
ees : enron direct ltd partnership is actually an enron north america entity
the others are either ees or bundled under ees even though they are thought of as enron facilities services / limbach companies
ega : here ' s where the going gets tough because the vast majority of these enron global assets entities have very complicated organization structures with
complicated , multi - layers structures that eventually lead back to enron corp . ownership . as you know all of the old subsets ( i . e . apachi , calme , etc . ) have
gone away and everything international is now ega . to the best of our knowledge , all of these entities and their employees are enron managed .
following are the exceptions and / or unusual organizational structure that should be noted :
electricidad enron de guatemala s . a . actually reports up through ena
san juan gas company , inc . in puerto rico is a direct sub of enron corp . ( 100 % owned )
enron american del sur , s . a . is an enron corp . / enron transportation services entity
no entity called enron singapore . . . . more than likely enron capital
no enron wind uk , no enron wind india . . . . but regardless , they are all part of the ewc / erec family .
global these entities all are a part of enron global exploration & production , inc . , which is owned by enron corp . , but one has indirect outside ownership .
ep : enron oil & gas india ltd . , for instance , is owned by enron asst holdings , which is owned by enron finance partners , which is part of a complex ownership
structure that includes one non - enron entity ( zephyrus investments , llc ) with a small interest .
again , i hope this information is helpful . for the most part the list appears to be in order except for the ones mentioned and for the fact that so many of the names are incomplete and hard to definitively track . let my group know if we can be of additional assistance .

"breaking news : ca governor declares state of emergency
posted 2 : 37 am ( cst ) jan 18 , 2001
late wednesday following a day of rolling blackouts and the prospect for more
with electricity supplies drying up throughout the west , california gov . gray
davis declared a state of emergency due to the power shortage and directed
the state water resources department to begin securing power supplies for the
beleaguered state grid . in making the bold move , gov . davis also announced
that his conservation plan for state facilities and operations already has
reached its goal of reducing energy use by more than 5 % .
in the emergency proclamation , the governor said that electricity presently
available through california three major investor - owned utilities is
"" insufficient to prevent widespread and prolonged disruptions of electric
service , "" and thus , he was ordering all state agencies to use their resources
to do whatever they can to alleviate the power shortage . then he went on to
specifically empower the water resources agency , which has been a key player
in helping the state ' s transmission grid operator ( cal - iso ) narrowly avoid
blackouts or avoid them being felt more pervasively throughout the state .
noting that peak electrical loads for state buildings and institutions are on
target for a 200 mw reduction and the water resources department peak pumping
load has been reduced by 450 mw , gov . davis lauded californians for having
"" stepped up to the plate and dramatically reduced their appetite for
electricity , "" noting that the state already is 47 th in the nation among the
lowest per - capita energy use and the state ' s electricity prices are the 10 th
highest in the nation .",ham

i have sent a mail to andreas with a full list of all the assumed units

data for cocoa beans and noticed that they were being quoted in gbp / mt so
even currency units seem to be important .

hi kirstee ,
thanks again for all your work on mg . one think to double check is units .
please , make sure that the prices are quoted in the same units our positions
come in .
one potential source of confusion arises from the fact that we are dealing
with different
cultures ( metric system vs . english measures ) .

hi vince ,
i was waiting for a comment about the email below before sending it to the
full mailing list . basically it suggests that the
copper option position may well have increased the var by more than $ 500 , 000 .
however , given that the portfoilo has also
changed from the lst of august it is difficult to asses the actual change due
to the option only .
regards
kirstee

hi all ,
the cu option position has entered the mg books for the 2 nd aug . the delta is
35299 $ / mt for dec 2000 . the cu var has gone up
from $ 2 , 245 , 000 to $ 3 , 306 , 000 . i estimated that the portfolio for the lst
would increase to approx $ 3 , 039 , 000 so this seems sensible .
the overall var change is from $ 4 , 780 , 796 to $ 5 , 991 , 569 . again , the estimate
for the lst aug was for an increase in var to ~ $ 5 , 476 , 000 .
all estimates were based on a delta of 32 , 0004 / dmt .
there has also been some increase in the var for aluminium which will effect
the overall total .
a summary is as follows :

"pavel , many thanks for your note .
i understand that digitals are not core enron business but as you know , i ' m
trying to explore digitals to give , for example , a company a guaranteed
income in year one ( to mop up expiring tax losses ) . this is offset by a
guaranteed expense in year two . see attached hypothetical example . the
digital will reflect an underlying commodity to which a company is exposed to
and would be part of a price risk management strategy , thereby giving it
' commercial purpose ' .
i would be interested in hearing from you generally on the subject - - the
rational for using digitals and your knowledge of its use in other markets
( electricity or other commoodity or in the banking sector ) .
it seems to me that setting the srike is key and a ' value judgement ' or am i
wrong , and are there curves and models which could help you substantiate
this ? in any event , do you have a feel for what an acceptable % of chance or
likelihood that a commodity price hits the strike on a digital before it
becomes non arm ' s length and does not pass the smell test ?

subject : digitals
digital options are extremely uncommon in the crude oil market . nobody ever
asked me to show quotes in the otc market . the only time we encountered them
was when producers , brought by our marketing team , wanted to sell a
knock - outable swap , whereby they would get a higher swap price in exchange
for cancelling the swap if the price settled below a certain level . this
structure had a digital put embedded in it , although the customers didn ' t
necessarilly know that . the companies were us oil and gas producers : venoco ,
titan , magnum hunter , patiena oil & gas , belco , central resources . it was
about 1 year ago . in the otc market , at about the same time , i asked for
quotes to hedge these transactions and sold a digital cal 00 $ 16 swaption to
elf and strips of digital puts to somebody else that i cannot recall .
i hope this helps .

i think we need to get a lot closer together - i expect geoff ( and the analyst working for geoff on this ) to be spending a lot more time down on the it floors . if we integrate at a much earlier stage we might not see any divergence from how geoff sees the end result to what actually appears .
could you consider how to get your team spending much more time with geoff - i would suggest you have a daily time when you all ( developers included ) sit down around a desk to look at progress .
let me know what you think ?

"please contact kristin walsh ( x 39510 ) or robert johnston ( x 39934 ) for further clarification .
executive summary :
utility bankruptcy appears increasingly likely next week unless the state can clear three hurdles - agreement on payback for the bailout , rate increases , and further short - term funding for dwr purchases of power .
disagreement persists between gov . davis and democrats in the legislature on how the state should be paid back for its bailout of the utilities . the split is over a stock warrant plan versus state ownership of utility transmission assets .
the economics of the long - term contracts appear to show that rate hikes are unavoidable because of the need to amortize the undercollected rates of the utilities during the recent rate freeze period .
air quality management district regulations are under review , but offer limited scope for providing additional generation capacity .
legislature democrats are feeling intense pressure from the left - wing consumer groups and are being forced to at least slow , if not stop , davis ' s bailout and rate hike plans . senator burton ' s eminent domain threats against generators , which reflect this pressure , are of little significance .
1 . bankruptcy outlook rising once again
a deal to finalize a debt workout continues to be just beyond the reach of the state , the utilities , and their creditors , with time running out on the debt forbearance arrangement set to expire on tuesday .
socal edison and pg & e are not paying any of their bills except for payroll . they are working very hard to keep cash on - hand , and have indicated that they feel that they are very close to an involuntary bankruptcy filing . once this filing occurs , they will have 50 days until either the bankruptcy court accepts the filing or the utilities file a voluntary bankruptcy .
opinion within the assembly is divided with respect to the outlook for bankruptcy . assemblyman keeley told our source that a filing is likely , but that everything will be resolved during that 50 - day period . senator john burton "" is in no hurry "" to reach a deal with the utilities , as he believes that the state of california is in a good position to "" strong - arm "" the utilities . burton currently does not intend to cede to the utilities so that they can avoid bankruptcy . the senator stated , "" bankruptcy would be bad , but not the worst thing possible . "" he intends to stick to his position . senator burton also dismissed governor davis ' end - of - week deadline for striking a deal with the utilities .
still , bankruptcy can be avoided if a last - minute deal can be struck monday on :
what the state receives in return for the bailout
the scope of rate hikes ( a federal court is expected to rule on the pg & e / socal v . cpuc rate undercollection case monday )
additional financing is made available to the dwr to buy more power until the revenue bonds can be issued in may .
there is a possibility that significant progress on these issues could lead to a further extension of creditor forbearance . however , the negative tone taken by standard & poors and others concerning delays in the legislature suggest that further forbearance will difficult to achieve . the previous forbearance period was only achieved via a high - level washington summit which does not appear likely to happen this weekend .
additional financing for dwr will not be automatically approved by the legislature . the non - energy expenditures of the california government are now at risk , as there is not yet a rate structure in place to recover the costs being expended on power from the general fund .
2 . state to take 2 / 3 of utility debt
while the state seems to have succeeded in forcing the utility parents to eat close to one third of the $ 12 billion debt , a final deal has been held up on two fronts . first , it is still unclear what the state will get in return for the utility debt . it is possible that there will be a mix of stock warrants and / or transmission assets . a takeover of the transmission assets seems more likely than a takeover of the hydro assets . the value of these assets still has not been settled . second , while the state will be on the hook for $ 9 billion , it is not clear what mixture of rate hikes and revenue bonds will be used to recover the cost of the bailout . finally , expect davis and other california politicians to work to minimize rate hikes ( although the edison / pg & e v . cpuc case on monday is likely to force their hand here ) and to do everything possible to avoid the appearance of a bailout . the tangible transmission assets are more politically attractive than the nebulous stock warrants .
no price has been set at which the state would purchase the utilities ' transmission assets , which are currently valued at approximately $ 7 - $ 8 billion . all of the proceeds though cannot be used to pay off the utilities ' debts , as some of the money would go to existing bondholders . however , ipp sources advise that there is already a bid on the table for these transmission assets that is higher than what the state would offer .
3 . long - term contracts
as noted by the governor in his announcement tuesday , only 500 mw of the 5 , 000 mw of power contracted for can come on - line immediately . much of the remainder reportedly was contracted in long - term purchases from suppliers who are building power plants . some of this will come on - line in approximately two years .
assemblyman keeley expressed frustration that he has received a "" tablet from on high "" from governor davis that there must not be a rate increase . this means that the state must acquire power , not from internal sources or from the market , but through long - term contracts at 7 . 39 cents / kwh . this allows 1 . 213 cents to amortize socal edison ' s undercollection from the recent rate freeze period . ( the number is slightly different for pg & e . ) this assumption is based on a natural gas price of $ 7 . 90 in 2001 and $ 5 . 15 in 2005 , and an efficiency heating rate of 10 , 000 - 12 , 000 in 2001 and 7 , 200 in 2005 .
these numbers were quoted to industry sources , who felt they were unrealistic . these sources quoted the 2001 price of natural gas as $ 9 . 00 - $ 9 . 50 . the sources agreed with keeley ' s number for the 2001 efficiency heating rate , but they felt that 7 , 200 in 2005 was very optimistic unless an enormous amount of new generation capacity comes on line .
according to keeley ' s numbers and assuming the filed rate case is settled at $ 7 billion rather than $ 12 billion , it would take 5 to 6 years to amortize all of the utility undercollection . a settlement to this case will need to be reached so that the state can figure out how much to charge for power in order to amortize the undercollection . however , since assemblyman keeley ' s numbers are unrealistic , a rate increase will be necessary .
4 . air quality district exemptions
there have been a few bills introduced to provide exemptions from aqmd ( air quality management district ) regulations - - ab 20 x , ab 28 x , ab 31 x . also , republicans have been asking the governor to lift the environmental regulations and immediately site the facility in san jose that was denied by the local government .
currently there is no contemplation of loosening the aqmd compliance restrictions . the legislature will not allow "" dirtier "" plants to
come on - line . however , there might be a change in the means of implementation in southern california by moving away from the
use of credits ( this apparently drives up the cost of gas - fired power ) .
5 . democratic moderates pressured by consumer advocates
the moderate left ( sen . burton , the puc , consumer activists ) is afraid of harvey rosenfield and his consumers movement . this is not just because of his initiative . more important from their perspective , his initiative puts him and the far left in a position to challenge and defeat the moderates in the next election . thus , democrats in the legislature will feel pressured to distance themselves from davis and slow down any further rate increases or bailout .
6 . eminent domain would have a limited effect
the threats by burton to seize generation assets to insure continued power supply are limited . they only apply to california suppliers . a
federal order would be needed to seize assets from out - of - state suppliers . there are also canadian suppliers ( such as bc hydro ) who are essentially untouchable .
7 . smaller ipps feeling the squeeze
many of the smaller ipps , which account for approximately 2500 mw of production , appear to be within a few days of running out of cash .
ab lx may be amended , possibly sometime this week , to give the smaller producers credit support .",ham

"from the desk of : dr tom eke .
e - mail : dr _ tomeke @ spinfinder . com
lagos - nigeria .
attn :
request for urgent business relationship .
it is with my profound dignity that i write you this
very important
and highly confidential letter . first , i must
solicit your strictest
confidentiality in this transaction . this is by
virtue of its nature
as being utterly confidential and "" top secret "" .
though i know that a
transaction of this magnitude will make any one
apprehensive and
worried , considering the fact that we have not met
each other before ,
but i am assuring you that all will be well at the
end of the day . we
have decided to contact you by email due to the
urgency of this
transaction , as we have been reliably informed that
it will take at
least a minimum of two to three weeks for a normal
post to reach you ,
so we decided it is best using the e - mail , which is
quicker and also
to enable us meet up with the second quater payment
for the year
2000 .
however , let me start by introducing myself properly
to you . i
am dr . tom eke , a director general in the department
of petroleum
resources ( d . p . r ) and i presently head the contract
award panel incharge
of contract awards and payment approvals . i came to
know of you in my search for a reliable and
reputable person to
handle a very confidential business transaction
which involves the
transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account
requiring
maximum confidence . i and my colleagues are top
officials of the
federal government contract award panel . our duties
include evaluation , vetting , approval for payment of
contract jobs
done for the d . p . r e . t . c . in order to commence this
business we
solicit for your assistance to enable us transfer
into your account
the said funds . the source of this funds is as
follows : in the second
quarter of 2001 this committee was mandated to
review and award
contracts to the tune of us $ 400 million us dollars
to a group of five
firms for the supply construction and installation
of oil pipe lines
in warri and port harcourt . during this process my
colleagues and i
decided and agreed among ourselves to deliberately
over - inflate the
total contract sum from us $ 400 million to us $ 431
million united
states dollars with the main intention of sharing
the remaining sum
of us $ 31 miilion amongst ourselves .
the federal government of nigeria has since the
second quater of
year 2001 approved the sum of us $ 431 million for us
as the contract sum ,
and the sum of us $ 400 million has also been paid to
the foreign companies
concerned as contract entitlements for the various
contracts done , but
since the companies are entiltled to us $ 400 million
dollars only , we are
now left with us $ 31 million dollars balance in the
account which we intend to
disburse amongst ourselves , but by virtue of our
positions as civil
servants and members of this panel , we cannot do
this by ourselves ,
as we are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau
( civil service
laws ) from opening and / or operating foreign accounts
in our names
while still in government service , making it
impossible for us to
acquire the money in our names right now . i have
therefore , been
delegated as a matter of trust and urgency by my
colleagues in the
panel to look for an overseas partner into whose
account we would
transfer the sum of us $ 31 million . hence we are
writing you this
letter . my colleagues and i have agreed that if you
or your company
can act as the beneficiary of this funds on our
behalf , you or your
company will retain 20 % of the total amount ( us $ 31
million ) , while
70 % will be for us ( officials ) and the remaining 10 %
will be used in
offsetting all debts / expenses and taxes incurred
both local and
foreign in the cause of this transfer . needless to
say , the trust
reposed on you at this juncture is enormous . in
return we demand your
complete honesty and trust .
you must however note that this transaction will be
strictly based
on the following terms and conditions as we have
stated below ;
a ) our conviction of your transparent honesty and
diligence
b ) that you would treat this transaction with utmost
secrecy and confidentiality
c ) that you will not ask for more share or try to
sit on the funds once it is under
your custody , or any form of blackmail .
d ) that upon receipt of the funds you will release
the funds as instructed
by us after you have removed your share of 20 % from
the total amount .
please , note that this transaction is 100 % legal and
risk free and we hope to conclude
this transaction seven to fourteen bank working days
from the date
of receipt of the necessary requirements from you .
we are looking
forward to doing business with you and solicit your
total confidentiality
in this transaction . there is no cause for alarm . i
give you my word that you
are completely safe in doing business with us .
transactions like this
have been successfully carried out in the past by
most government
executives . here in my country there is great
economic and political
disarray and thus looting and corruption is rampant
and the order of
the day , thus explaining why you might have heard
stories of how
money is been taken out of nigeria , this is because
everyone is
making desperate attempts to secure his or her
future , so that when
we retire from active service we donot languish in
poverty . i will
explain more to you when i have heard from you .
please acknowledge the receipt of this letter using
the above e - mail address .
i will bring you into the complete picture of this
pending business
transaction when i have heard from you and also
receive your
confidential telephone and fax numbers to enable me
fax to you all
necessary information you need to know about our
pending business
transaction . i will also send to you my private
telephone and fax
numbers where you can always reach me . your urgent
response will be
highly appreciated to enable us transfer the funds
under the second
quarter of the year 2002 . thank you and god bless .
yours faithfully ,
dr . tom eke .
n . b . please be informed that this business
transaction is 100 % legal
and completely free from drug money or money
laundering . this is a
complete legitimate business transaction .

subject : ena sales on hpl
just to update you on this project ' s status :
based on a new report that scott mills ran for me from sitara , i have come up
with the following counterparties as the ones to which ena is selling gas off
of hpl ' s pipe .
altrade transaction , l . l . c . gulf gas utilities company
brazoria , city of panther pipeline , inc .
central illinois light company praxair , inc .
central power and light company reliant energy - entex
ces - equistar chemicals , lp reliant energy - hl & p
central illinois light company southern union company
d & h gas company , inc . texas utilities fuel company
duke energy field services , inc . txu gas distribution
entex gas marketing company union carbide corporation
equistar chemicals , lp unit gas transmission company inc .
since i ' m not sure exactly what gets entered into sitara , pat clynes
suggested that i check with daren farmer to make sure that i ' m not missing
something ( which i did below ) . while i am waiting for a response from him
and / or mary smith , i will begin gathering the contractual volumes under the
above contracts .

subject : ena sales on hpl
i am working on a project for brenda herod & was wondering if one of you
could tell me if i ' m on the right track & if this will get everything for
which she is looking .
she is trying to draft a long - term transport / storage agreement between ena &
hplc which will allow ena to move the gas to their markets . in order to
accomplish this , she needs to know all of the sales to customers that ena is
doing off of hpl ' s pipe .
i had scott mills run a report from sitara showing all ena buy / sell activity
on hpl since 7 / 99 . if i eliminate the buys & the desk - to - desk deals , will
this give me everything that i need ?
are there buy / sell deals done with ena on hpl ' s pipe that wouldn ' t show up in
sitara ? someone mentioned something about deals where hpl transports the gas
on it ' s own behalf then ena sells it to a customer at that same spot - -
? ? ? ? ? do deals like that happen ? would they show up in sitara ?
is there anything else that i ' m missing ? i ' m not real familiar with how some
of these deals happen nowadays so am very receptive to any
ideas / suggestions / help that you can offer ! ! !
thanks in advance .",ham
"daren :
on 1 / 25 / 2000 the above meter has recorded flow of 18 mmbtus into hpl ' s
pipeline . currently , the volume is booked to hpl strangers gas contract .
logistics needs approval to write - off this volume to unaccounted for gas .
( please print , sign , and return original to clem cernosek ) .
approval to write - off the volumes to unaccounted for gas loss
the above meter was a new meter effective 1 / 1 / 2000 , and therefore , the volume
flowing into hpl was probably caused by putting the meter in service .

hello mary -
here is a rough strating point of the ase studio planning document . i have
included the objectives we discussed initially - we will continue to refine
them as we move forward .
also , i inserted the notes i made during the offsite on friday . my notes
were primarily focused on information that the participants were wanting or
that i thought might be useful . also , i jotted down quite a few questions
that came up during the session . some of them were addressed on friday and
others were not . we do not necessarily need to address all of these at the
ase - and i would suspect there are others that should be addressed but are
not listed here . i ' m sending this information in advance for your review and
thought .
if you have any questions or would like to discuss , please let me know .

"us financial markets
emergency site relocation
the emergency site relocation for firms affected by the wtc bombing is going well on the fixed income and commodities trading side . trading is being relocated largely to new jersey and connecticut . there was very significant contingency planning here , and it is being put to good use . the futures and equities markets are not moving as quickly due to telecommunications problems . bond trading , which will resume in tokyo tonight ( as reported in the press ) , means that the cash market in the us should start to come back tomorrow .
forex
the foreign exchange markets have been quiet , as the fed reportedly stepped in and told people to settle their outstanding issues , but not to initiate new directional positions or large arbitrages .
insurance
the insurance firms most affected by the crisis are ing reinsurance and allianz . these firms may have capital issues from insuring losses related to the crisis - they were overconcentrated in this area .
transportation / infrastructure issues
telecommunications
communication issues continue to be the biggest problem . this is the only area where sufficient redundancy was lacking . for example , citigroup is having problems with e - mail capacity and is cutting back on all non - essential e - mails . this continues to be the chief barrier to resuming operations .
crude / products / refineries
loop terminal now restored to regular operations .
maritime traffic
according to dow jones , dry bulk shipowners were reluctant to lease out vessels on long - term contracts wednesday , after terrorist attacks in the u . s . tuesday brought security issues to the fore
air traffic
midway airlines announced today that effective immediately it has suspended all future flight operations . their press release states that "" this action is being taken at this time in order to preserve the value available for midway ' s interest holders and with the recognition that following the recent terrorist attacks demand for air transportation is expected to decline sharply . ""
us - canada border
bc border open but moving very slowly . delay for trucks at bc truck crossing now up to about 6 hrs . truckers being sorted into two groups , those with papers and order and those without papers in order . all trucks being checked extensively . only us residents and those on important business are being let back into the us .
rail traffic
all canadian pacfiic railway ( cpr - freight ) operations in canada and the us continuing to operate as normal . all cpr border crossings open and moving as planned .
politics
saudi oil minister states that saudi arabia and opec to cooperate to cover any oil supply shortage .

susan ,
hope you had a great new year and holiday season ! i have a couple of issues
i want ot clear up for this year ' s contract .
the question is how valero wants to treat the three meter locations where you
are currently pulling gas . our new contract that was just sent to you has a
minimum take of 60 , 000 mmbtu ( estimated 35 , 000 @ 8018 celanese , 15 , 000 @ 1233
texas city , and 10 , 000 @ 1394 dodge street ) . if you undertake at any meter
excess volumes from another meter would be used to fulfill the entire 60 , 000
mmbtu . my accountant has told me that this is causing difficulties with the
two plants and how they want to see gas purchases broken out . we discussed
this on the phone and i got your consent to split these invoices . now we are
being told all three invoices need to be separate . since we always aim to
please the customer , here is my recommendation for handling the contract
through it ' s term . please let me know if this is fine .
celanese 35 , 000 mmbtu / d minimum on any given day if volumes fall below
35 , 000 hplc will buy back these volumes at gd katy mid
two days after flow
texas city 15 , 000 mmbtu / d minimum on any given day if volumes fall below
15 , 000 hplc will buy back these volumes at gd katy mid

dodge street 10 , 000 mmbtu / d minimum on any given day if volumes fall below

george -
here ' s the story .
research forwarded to their personnel a solicitation they received for java
training by an outside person , weeklong classes for true beginners and for
those with decent programming experience in other languages ( esp c + + ) . vince
had pre - agreed tlo pay for it for anyone who wanted it . but , the response
they got was so "" overwhelming "" they reconsidered , for financial reasons , and
decided it would be better to just hire a professor to teach a class for a
week here . the costs would be around $ 15 , 000 , and there should be room for
around 15 people in the class . they have 6 - 8 people , and wonder if we might
have some people who would want to do it ( a no - brainer - java is a big - time
resume pad these days ) and would be willing to share the costs with them .
what is your opinion on this ? personally , i think it ' s a relatively
inexpensive investment in our people , although , selfishly , it does increase
their ' market value ' so to speak . ( of course , nothing keeps directors from
going to the class as well : ) )

subject : treatment of hpl bank accounts
dwayne and gary ,
at the request of brian redmond , i have prepared and am forwarding to you a
draft of an amendment to the purchase and sale agreement that will reflect
the agreement that the hpl bank accounts will be retained by enron after the
closing and that aep will set up its own new hpl accounts at its preferred
banks after closing . it is my understanding from mary perkins of enron that
the procedures set out in the amendment were agreed to by jana soward of
aep . please review the enclosed and let me know if you have any
comments . we would like to get this one issue resolved and out of the way
as soon as possible . thanks and hope you both are doing well .

i plan to be in houston on july 5 - 7 . i would like very much to get together
with you and perhaps your investment guy on friday morning on the 7 th if you
and / or he have the time or perhaps on the 5 th in the afternoon . i would
like to continue the discussions about your using marketpoint and about your
investment guy considering marketpoint if he is interested . when you see
the progress we have made , i think you will agree that it merits
consideration as a part of enrononline . com as well as a profitable
investment in its own right . it is still in the situation where it can be
provided exclusively to whomever i choose ; i have been very , very careful
how i have promoted it so that i do not get committed to a second - rate
partner .
i also have what i think is a fundamentally new , general markovian forward
optionality evaluator . i wrote my ph . d . dissertation at stanford in the
1970 s ( defended with honors ) in semi - markovian decision processes during the
heyday of that research , and i have seen direct applications in optionality
evaluation . i think you will be fascinated to see and review it . it is
presently implemented in prototype form and it could be made available to
the first large retainer client on an exclusive basis who is sufficiently
interested . if you want to be that retainer client , that would be of
interest to me .
give me a shout via return email or by my cell phone at 650 . 218 . 3069
regarding schedule . i am out of town this week but available via email or
phone at the above addresses .
i really hope we can get together that week if we possibly can . thanks very
much for considering my request , and thanks very much for being the go
between with your investment guy . i deeply appreciate it . i hope to see
you on the 5 th or 7 th .

"dear dr . kaminski ,
i was recently allowed to release into the public domain on the limited basis
the first of the preprints that i recently authored on my model for spikes in
power prices and for the valuation of the contingent claims on power . in this
regard , i have just given a talk on this model at the joint seminar of the
center for energy finance education and research and the institute for
computational finance at the ut austin . right now i am also in the process of
forming a list of specialists both in the industry and academia who might be
interested in receiving this preprint . please let me know if you might be
interested in receiving this preprint .
i look forward to hearing from you .
sincerely yours ,

ps . here are the main preprints that i have recently authored on my model for
spikes in power prices and valuation of contingent claims on power :
1 . valery a . kholodnyi , the stochastic process for power prices with spikes

valuation of european contingent claims on power , preprint , txu - rag - 01 / 00 ,

2 . valery a . khlolodnyi , valuation of a swing option on power with spikes ,

3 . valery a . kholodnyi , valuation of a spark spread option on power with
spikes ,
preprint txu - rag - 21 / 00 , november 2000 .
4 . valery a . kholodnyi , valuation of european contingent claims on power at
two
distinct points on the grid with spikes in both power prices , preprint
txu - rag - 24 / 00 , november 2000 .
5 . valery a . kholodnyi , valuation of a transmission option on power with
spikes ,
preprint txu - rag - 25 / 00 , november 2000 .
as i have indicated to you in my previous e - mail , contrary to the standard
approaches , i model spikes directly , as self - reversing jumps on top of a
stochastic process for the regular dynamics of power prices in the absence of
spikes . in this way the dynamics of power prices is modeled as a non - markovian
process , even if the process for the regular dynamics of power prices is
markovian . among other things my model for spikes allows for the explicit
valuation and hedging of contingent claims on power with spikes , provided that
the corresponding contingent claims on power can be valued and hedged in the
absence of spikes .",ham
"bill ; mike cashell ( mpc ' s transmission mgr . ) just phoned me concerned , because mpc ' s real - time group requested epmi purchase energy for them under our existing energy imbalance structure , and was notified by our real - time group that due to the newly implemented ferc price cap , we were have difficulty securing any resources . just to clarify things , we are settling mpc ' s choice customers energy imbalance position , and pp & l montana has the right to any length resulting from mpc ' s "" domestic "" load energy imbalance . in other words mpc is settling two separate energy imbalance accounts , so during the hour they may be turning energy back to pp & l montana , while at the same time finding themselves short for the choice loads . during the recent bullish pricing conditions , choice customer were leaving themselves long , as of late , mpc is experiencing the choice customers doing the opposite , positioning themselves short . the net result is that mpc will most likely be expecting us to fill a short position from this point on , so i ' d really like to see what we can do to honor their requests , mindful of the favorable position we ' ve enjoyed over the last several months . let me know if you ' d like to discuss this further , or better yet if you ' ve got a workable solution to the problem . in the meantime , thanks again to you and your staff for the outstanding performance thus far in dealing with mpc . john",ham

request for business partnership
in my quest for a reliable and trusted partner for a highly important and lucrative venture cum investment , i came across your contact as a reliable partner for this venture .
i am sir . richard mbali , one of the senior accountants of amalgamated bank of south africa ( absa ) . to highlight you on this proposal , there is an account opened in this bank since 1980 . after going through it , i discovered that if i do not remit this money out urgently it would be forfeited for nothing . the owner of this account is mr . ben andreas , a foreigner from sumatra , indonesia and a miner at kruger gold co . , a geologist by profession . mr . ben andreas was with his family on holiday in his country . they died in one of the coastal areas across asia that was hit by massive tsunamis triggered by the worst earthquake in 40 years . the number of people killed throughout asia has now reached over 226 , 000 with tens of thousands still missing .
it is a confirmed fact that mr . ben andreas and his family lost their lives on december 26 , 2004 during the earthquake that occurred off the west coast of sumatra in indonesia . this was further proved to be a reality by dr . doti indrasantra , a director in the ministry of health affairs department in sumatra . dr . indrasantra visited south africa last year on a hiv / aids health programme ( 2004 international health team conference held in sandton , johannesburg ) . i was introduced to him by the late mr . ben andreas who i am his banker . i confirmed from dr . indransatra that mr . ben andreas and his family died shortly after visiting him in his house in sumatra
no other person knows about this and my investigation further proved to me that his company does not know anything about this account and the amount involved as he made it his personal account . the money outstanding before his death was ( usd 26 million ) twenty six million united states dollars .
i am now contacting you as a foreigner because this money cannot be approved to a national with a local bank account here . but can only be approved to any foreign account because the money is in us dollars and the former owner , a foreigner . i implore you to act as foreigner and beneficiary to the fund as i will then intimate you on the processes abound as well as procure all the necessary documents required to lay claim to the money .
if you are capable and willing to handle such amount in strict confidence and trust according to my instructions and advice for our mutual benefit i shall highly appreciate . i need trusted person in this business because i do not want to make mistakes ; i need your strong
assurance and trust . with my position now in the office i can effect transfer of this money to any foreigner ' s reliable account , which you can provide with assurance that this money will be intact pending my arrival in your country for disbursement . on the alternative , you can come
down here to south africa for us to meet one to one .
send me your private telephone and fax numbers upon receipt of this proposal , if you genuinely want to assist and be a co - partner . i will also wants us to meet face to face , to enable us sign a binding agreement . as soon as you receive this money into a foreign account or any account of your choice where the fund will be safe . i will proceed to your country for onward percentage distributions and investment . i need your full co - operation to make this work because the management is ready to approve this payment to any foreigner , who has correct information of this account , which i will give to you later immediately . i will use my
position and influence to effect legal approvals and onward transfer of this money to your account with appropriate clearance forms of the ministries and foreign exchange departments .
at the conclusion of this business , for your assistance , 25 % of the total amount will be accrue for you , 70 % for me , while 5 % will be for expenses both parties might have incurred during the process of the transfer .
i implore you to maintain the absolute confidentiality of this transaction .
your earliest response is urgently awaited .
truely yours ,
richard mbali

subject : re : cgi proposal update
greg and rex ,
thanks for the input . i will try to contact beth apollo .
here are a few points i think will help .
? i also read the partnering agreement carefully and sent the revised copy to
travis mccullough this morning
? at this time i believe our risk is quite low , as we are not officially part
of the bid yet
? i will work very hard to keep everyone informed
the following points protect enron from significant risk :
1 ) we were quite careful about what we sent to csg ( reviewed by beth ,
david , rahul and myself )
2 ) we did not quote any price for software or services
3 ) the original rfp asked for a custom solution , which cgi is proposing . we
do not participate in this work .
4 ) the option to take a different approach ( e . g . leverage existing software
from a partner ) is being proposed by csg as an alternative approach , but is
not priced . the option would be explored during a "" make versus buy "" analysis
within csg ' s methodology ( during the initial requirements and design phase ) .
this gives us time to clarify our plans .
i hope these points might mitigate any concerns over the rapid time frame of
the proposal . as the proposal is due on monday , i am not sure if there is
time to engage a large number of reviewers , but i will ask csg to copy rahul
and hopefully he can get appropriate input .

a brief update :
i spoke with the proposal leads at cgi ( greg felton and company ) this
morning , and all appears to be on schedule .
? greg communicated our joint approach to the client and they are very
interested
? greg received enron ' s materials and they are more than sufficient for our
current proposal needs
? i received a draft of cgi ' s proposed teaming agreement . i made made edits
according to my knowledge of enron ' s legal policies . i will forward the
document to legal if cgi accepts the changes
? greg will complete cgi ' s initial proposal and forward the draft to enron ,
for review , this weekend and on monday
? the proposal is due monday pm to cms
? presentations to cms by potential vendors will occur on march 26 th - 28 th .
we should think about who attends and at what point we might want to use our
internal contacts to approach the client . for now we are waiting , based on
cgi ' s advice .
? since the client is in the requirements phase , we should think about how we
might want to support that process , given our approach to delivering systems
solutions
thanks for everyone ' s support .

thank you for your e - mail . my phone number is ( 617 ) 492 - 9551 .
i graduated from princeton university in 1996 ( mathematics ) , and came
straight to mit for a
ph . d . in operations management at the sloan schoolof management . in my first
three years i took all the required coursework in mathematics ,
optimization , stochastic processes , etc . , as well as a number of courses in
psychology ( at mit and harvard ) . i am working with prof . gabriel bitran ,
and i am interested in the mathematical modeling of service operations . in
particular , i am interested in the interaction between customers and
companies ( hence the interest in psychology ) . the ( tentative ) title of my
phd thesis is "" pricing substitute products on the internet "" , and i am
sending you the summary which i sent to tom gros a few weeks ago that will
give you an idea of what this research is about .
thanks again , and i ' m looking forward to meeting you and your research

pricing substitute products on the internet
objective :
to develop new tools to decide pricing policies for goods and services sold
on
the internet .
motivation :
this research is motivated by the fact that traditional choice and
optimization
models are not appropriate for internet - related businesses . the technological
innovations associated with the internet brought about an overload of
information
which inevitably affects the ways in which consumers make choices .
furthermore ,
companies have a great deal of influence on how much information consumers can
have access to .
the problem of pricing substitute products is an important strategic issue
faced
by internet companies . consumers usually search for generic products ( e . g .
vcrs
or computers ) without knowing exactly what they will buy . companies can show
different products and different prices to each consumer . this type of
flexibility
was not available until the internet came about .
the problem of pricing substitute products is not unique to the internet . the
methodology developed by this research should be transferable to a number of
other settings , such as pricing services . services are unique , and there are
many cases where customers will only buy one of many services offered by a
given company . our model will help companies decide which services to offer
to which customers and how much to charge for these services .
research strategy :
our research strategy is to divide the pricing problem into two components
which can be combined to generate optimal pricing strategies . these
components are choice models and optimization models .
choice models :
choice models describe how customers make choices . the management literature
draws on two main sources for these models : psychology and economics . the
common approach in psychology models is to use what are called heuristic
elimination methods . these methods consist of the elimination of options
based on the sequential elimination of features until only one choice
remains .
these methods tend to be very context - specific and do not lend themselves very
easily to mathematical analysis . economists focus on utility - maximing models
that are significantly more mathematically tractable than psychological
models .
the most common economic model of choice is the logit model . the problem with
these types of models is that they are not very accurate reflections of how
consumer make choices on the internet . the first step in our research will
be
to develop choice models that capture the interactions going on between
customers
and companies on the internet .
optimization :
traditionally , the optimization problem consists of maximizing revenue over a
certain planning horizon . on the internet , the problem of maximizing revenue
still exists , but there is also a need to learn about customers . short term
profit is based on sales , but long term profit is based on how well you know
your customers and are able to retain them . the optimization problem must
therefore include a short term component ( sales ) and a long term component
( learning ) .",ham

"hi grant ,
hope all is well with you . i trust you got my message via the voicemail
that ileft with vince late friday afternoon about my inability to travel -
i ' m trying to rearrange my trip for a couple of week ' s time when my ear has
cleared up , and i look forward to meeting with you one day .
i wrote to vince last week asking for a favour , but i ' m not sure ifhe is
there in houston . i know that you guys are probably very busy but i was
wondering if you can write a few sentences for me . i ' m sending out some
sample chapters to the people who responded positively ( all of them ! ) to my
request for some feedback on the book . chapter 1 has an ' overview ' of the
book with just a couple of sentences on each chapter . could you please
write a sentence or two for your chapter ?
i ' m including what i have already written ( although i think it has changed
slightly from this version ) so that you can see the style .
many thanks and best regards .
chris .
2 overview of this book
this book aims to provide an in - depth understanding of the pricing and risk
management of energy derivatives . in the remainder of this chapter we give
an overview of the fundamental principals needed to model and price energy
assets , and which underlie the rest of the book . as well as introducing
the techniques that underlie the black - scholes modelling framework we
discuss the numerical techniques of trinomial trees and monte carlo
simulation for derivative pricing which are used extensively later in the
book .
in chapter 2 we analyse spot energy prices . apart from describing
empirical prices we propose a number of processes that can be used to model
the prices . we look at the well - know process of gbm as well as mean
reversion , stochastic volatility and jump processes , discussing each , and
showing how they can be simulated and their parameters estimated .
chapter 3 , written by vince kaminski and grant masson of enron capital and
trade .
chapter 4 examines forward curves in the energy markets . although such
curves are well understood and straight forward in the world debt markets
the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well defined
curves . what we do in this chapter
chapter 5 presents an overview of the common and not - so - common derivative
structures in the energy markets and discusses their uses . examples of
products analysed in this chapter include a variety of swaps , caps , floors
and collars , as well as energy swaptions , compound options , asian ( or
average rate ) options , barriers , lookbacks , and ladder options .
chapter 6 investigates single and multi - factor models of the energy spot
price and the pricing of some standard energy derivatives . closed form
solutions for forward prices , forward volatilities , and european option
prices are derived and presented for all the models in this chapter
including a three factor stochastic convenience yield and interest rate
model with jumps .
chapter 7 shows how the prices of path dependent and american style options
can be evaluated for the models in chapter 6 . simulation schemes are
developed for the evaluation of european style options and applied to a
variety of path dependent options . in order to price options which
incorporate early exercise opportunities , a trinomial tree scheme is
developed . this tree is built to be consistent with the observed forward
curve and can be used to price exotic as well as standard american style
options .
chapter 8 develops a new methodology for valuing energy options based on
modelling the market observed forward curve . the approach results in a
multi - factor model that is able to capture realistically the evolution of a
wide range of energy forward curves and where the user defined volatility
structures can be of an extremely general form . closed - form solutions are
developed for pricing standard european options and efficient monte carlo
schemes for exotic options . the chapter finishes with a discussion of the
valuation of american style options .
chapter 9 focuses on the risk management of energy derivative positions .
in this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions
that sell options or other derivatives to a client and who is then faced
with the problem of managing the risk through time . we begin with delta
hedging a portfolio containing derivatives and look at extensions to gamma
hedging - using the models from chapters 5 and 7 . the general model of
chapter 7 ideally suited to multi - factor hedging and this is also
discussed .
chapter 10 looks at the key risk - management concept of value at risk
applied to portfolios containing energy derivative portfolios . after
discussing the concept of the measure , we look at how the key inputs
( volatilities , covariances , correlations , etc ) can be estimated . we then
compare the fours major methodologies for computing var ; delta ,
delta - gamma , historical simulation and monte - carlo simulation . finally , we
look at testing the var estimates for various underlying energy market
variables .",ham

"kim , i know you have been interested in the development of a long term
natural gas model for use in the ets revenue management effort . i agree that
the ability to model various supply / demand scenarios for north america
should prove useful in ets business development efforts , and in particular ,
in predicting the impact of the new , large alaskan gas supplies on the n . a .
pipeline grid .
as you know , vince kaminski feels that a software product developed by dale
nesbitt ( marketpoint , inc . ) of los altos hills , ca . may be a good choice , and
one readily available in a relatively short time . marketpoint has proposed
that they work with us in our offices for a week of intensive training and
testing , so we can make a more informed decision before ordering the
software . they have proposed a charge of $ 12 , 000 , plus expenses , for the
one - week session , with that cost applied to the first year ' s subscription
price ( approx . $ 55 - 60 m / yr ) should we decide to go forward . the other
details ( timing , ene resources required , necessary it interface , etc ) still
need to be worked out , but i believe there is generally a consensus to
proceed with the test .
with my recent relocation to the clean fuels group , i will no longer be
responsible for the alaskan pipeline development . however , danny mccarty is
pulling together a team consisting of people from nng , nbp and elsewhere in
ets to push the project forward . i believe eric gadd will be playing a key
role as well . the decision on the long term gas model should appropriately
be made by the new project team .
i have attached a draft of the proposed marketpoint license agreement . it
has not yet been fully reviewed by legal ( or by shelley c . for the
"" affiliate "" issues ) .
let me know if i can provide any other background or assistance .

and extended family members as well as a few close friends .
i want god to be merciful to me and accept my soul so , i have decided to
give alms to charity organizations ,
as i want this to be one of the last good deeds i do on earth . so far ,
i have distributed money to some charity organizations in the u . a . e ,
algeria and malaysia . now that my health has deteriorated so badly , i
cannot do this myself anymore . i once asked members of my family to
close one of my accounts and distribute the money which i have
there to charity organization in bulgaria and pakistan , they refused
and kept the money to themselves . hence , i do not trust them anymore ,
as they seem not to be contended with what i have left for them . the
last of my money which no one knows
of is the huge cash deposit of eighteen million dollars
$ 18 , 000 , 000 , 00 that i have with a finance / security
company abroad . i will want you to help me collect
this deposit and dispatched it to charity
organizations . i have set aside 25 % for you and for
your time . n . b alternative

subject : el paso had market power
in a release from natural gas intelligence according to ferc staff counsel , el paso natural gas and el paso merchant energy possessed market power during the summer of 2000 and violated ferc ' s marketing affiliate standards . the article states that el paso had market power after may 2000 for at least two months when pipeline capacity constraints created a separate relevant geographic market in california . the evidence pointed to the now - infamous february 7 and 9 , 2000 telephone conversations showing that the operating employees of el paso merchant , el paso natural gas and mojave pipeline "" were not functioning independently , "" according to staff counsel .
the phone conversations took place just days before el paso pipeline began its open season for 1 . 22 bcf / d of firm , capacity on its system ( bound for california ) , all awarded to el paso merchant .
before and during the open season , epme gained new information about the restructured long - term tiered discount on mojave to wheeler ridge while potential non - affiliate shippers were not according to counsel . as a result , counsel find that epme ' s group had an undue competitive advantage with the new mojave discount generating a successful bid for the el paso pipeline capacity .
ferc chief alj wagner is expected to issue an initial decision in early october .",ham

"last year the enron political action committee ( pac ) launched a campaign to
become a "" million dollar pac "" . enron employees , who provide all of the
funding for the pac , responded and the enron pac reached its objective ,
becoming one of the largest corporate pacs . this year we face a new
challenge . with the sale of eog , the announced sale of pge and normal
employee turnover , we have lost a significant number of consistent
contributors . we are seeking your support . if you are not a member , please
join . if you are a member , we hope you will consider increasing your
contribution .
the enron pac is an essential tool in our effort to promote sound public
policy . our pac funds support local , state and federal candidates , of both
parties , who support open markets , deregulation and customer choice . amounts
contributed may be used to make political contributions in connection with
federal and state elections and are subject to the limits of the federal
election campaign act . while our pac has grown thanks to our employee
contributions , it still generates just a fraction of the expenditures of
those who oppose these ideals .
this year , as always , we face challenges and opportunities for every one of
our businesses , including such issues as taxation and regulation of
e - commerce , electric industry restructuring , regulation of derivatives ,
international trade and investment legislation , pipeline safety , local and
state decisions affecting the siting and interconnection of power plants and
a variety of environmental and tax issues . enron has a long and successful
track record of supporting and advancing good public policy . that track
record depends on access to and regular communication with , decision makers .
the pac provides that access - - it shows policy makers that real voters care
about what they are doing .
one of the best things about enron is that we don  , t just take things as they
are . we challenge the status quo . we ask why . we change things . the pac
helps us do that . we need you to help the pac . sign up today - and please
consider the following contribution guidelines :
manager $ 500 / year
director $ 750 / year
sr . director / general manager $ 1 , 000 / year
vice president $ 2 , 500 / year
sr . vp / managing director $ 3 , 500 / year
executive committee $ 5 , 000 / year
all contributions are voluntary and these guidelines are merely suggestions .
you are free to contribute more or less than the guidelines suggested and
enron will not favor or disadvantage anyone by reason of the amount of their
contribution or their decision not to contribute . you may refuse to
contribute without fear of reprisal .
only u . s . citizens and resident - aliens living in the u . s . can contribute to
the enron pac . the maximum contribution is $ 5 , 000 per year per individual .
an individual may not contribute more than $ 25 , 000 to all federal candidates
and committees within a calendar year . the law requires that enron report
name , address , employer and occupation for every person who contributes over
$ 200 / year .
no portion of any contribution is deductible as a charitable contribution for
federal income tax purposes .
thanks for your support ! sign up now , or revise your current contribution

there seems to be some confusion around who will own the intellectual property for the treasury workstation application . it was mary ' s and my understanding that the ip would remain with the estate and a license would be given to netco to use the application . jay was under the impression that the ip was to be transferred to netco . could someone please clarify .

"please find attached a letter from lad and pat of socal . tw was requested by socal to reallocate the needles "" window "" on intraday 1 cycle last friday . socal lowered the "" window "" below tw ' s firm requirements . this has not been the policy previously followed by the two companies . once the socal "" window "" was established on the timely cycle , the window would not change for that gas day . i did not want to cut tw ' s ft shippers late on friday . i wanted time to alert them that this policy was changing and they could not rely on getting the same allocation of gas at needles during each daily cycle .
lynn and i talked with pat davidson and tw has agreed to accomodate any changes ( increases or decreases ) to the "" window "" during a particular gas day except for the intraday 2 cycle . lynn and i told pat that changing the allocation during intraday 2 cycle would create imbalances on tw ' s system , and tw was not allowed to have shipper imbalances per its tariff .

subject : cost sharing of subscription to poten ' s fuel oil report
all :
ideally we will split this cost evenly among as many p & l ' s as need the
report , minimizing everyone ' s cost by sharing a single subscription .
please tell me whether you can justify sharing the cost and if so , the rc
code & co # for me to allocate your cost share . please indicate your choice
of the three cost choices .
attached note below clarifies poten ' s proposal on the $ 10 , 000 / yr subscription .
essentially we have three choices :
1 . for $ 2700 / yr , the standard edition ( 11 issues , excluding the monthly
"" special feature "" article )
2 . for $ 3800 / yr the premium edition , ( standard edition plus the monthly
"" special feature "" article , as in three attached examples )
3 . for $ 10 , 000 / yr the premium edition plus quarterly forward price view for
36 months .
poten explains that 85 % of their subscribers take the premium service . no
one has ever asked for the $ 10 , 000 / yr long - term price forecast . i have an
interest in a longer term price forecast and hope that it may be useful to
others in the corporation .
the example copies attached include the following special feature articles :
99 feb - analysis of resid trades in the eastern mediterranean
99 sep - patterns of fuel oil trade in the western hemisphere
99 dec - analysis of the resid market in chile
one either takes all or none of them for the incremental $ 1100 / yr . some may
be useless , others perhaps quite valuable . your call .

i look forward to hearing from you .

niamh & doug & margaret :
i want to chat about this and will call you , but the essence is :
can you justify sharing the cost of subscribing to poten ' s monthly fuel oil
report ?
attached below are 3 example copies that include their standard 12 month
price forecasts . the cost is $ 3800 / yr .
as an added service for a total of $ 10 , 000 / yr , poten will include a quarterly
update of their 36 month forward view on crude oil and fo prices with a brief
justification for their view . this would include the standard monthly price
forecast for the prompt 12 months and quarterly prices for the following 24
months for far east , med and nwe . ( i expect a more descriptive email from
poten , but i think this is the essence of their "" custom "" offer . )
the example copies attached include the following special features :
99 feb - analysis of resid trades in the eastern mediterranean
99 sep - patterns of fuel oil trade in the western hemisphere
99 dec - analysis of the resid market in chile
these type of features are produced monthly and run a spectrum of subjects
related to fuel oil .
i have a hard time justifying the cost of the newsletter and the price
forecast without the considered recommendation of colleagues such as yourself
regarding the utility of such a report . the best way to show your
recommendation is with money . if it is not worth any money to anyone else in
ene , then i have to question its validity and utility to me as well . doug ,
would this perhaps be useful to any other business units that have exposure
to fo prices ?

"request for your unreserved asistance
from : branch manager
( union bank of nigeria plc )
marina lagos
dear sir ,
request for your unreserved asistance
firstly , i must solicit your confidence in this transaction , this is by virtue
of its nature as being utterly confidential and top secret . though i know
that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried ,
but i am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day . we have
decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction , as we have
been reliably informed of it ' s
swiftness and confidentiality .
let me start by first introducing myself properly to you . i am yakasia mohammed
a manager at the union bank nigeria plc , lagos . i came to know of you in
my private search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential
transaction , which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign
account requiring maximum confidence . a foreigner , an oil merchant / contractor
with the federal government of nigeria , until his death three years ago in
a ghastly air crash , banked with us here at the union bank plc , lagos , and
had a closing balance of usd $ 7 . 2 m ( seven million , two hundred thousand united
states dollars ) which the bank now unquestionably expects to be claimed by
any of his available foreign next of kin or alternatively be donated to a
discredited trust fund for arms and ammunition at a military war collage
here in nigeria .
fervent valuable efforts are being made by the union bank to get in touch
with any of his next of kin ( he had no known wife and children ) that the
management under the influence of our chairman , board of directors , retired
major general ( egbuna o egbu ) , that an arrangement for the fund to be declared
"" uncliamable "" and then be subsequently donated to the trust fund for arms
and ammunition , which will further enhance the course of misunderstanding
among us here .
in order to avert this negative development , myself and some of my trusted
colleagues in the bank now seek for your permission to have you stand as
the next of kin so that the fund , usd $ 7 . 2 m , would be subsequently transferred
and paid into your bank account as the beneficiary next of kin .
all documents and proves to enable you get this fund have been carefully
worked out and we are assuring you a 100 % risk free
involvement . your share would be 30 % of the total amount , while the rest
would be for myself and my colleagues for purposes in your country .
if this proposal is ok by you and you do not wish to take advantage of the
trust we hope to bestow on you and your company , then kindly get to me immediately
via my private e - mail address ( yakasiahaji 2 @ hotmail . com ) furnishing me with
your most confidential telephone , fax and e - mail , so that i can forward to
you the relevant details of this transaction .
thank you in advance for your anticipated co - operation

dear guillermo ,
we ask that you be patient with us as we are affected by the recent changes
in the state of california .
where we had an agreement with dwr , the governor . mr . davis , cancelled all
loi contracts issued by dwr as of last friday , we just learned this today .
however , for us , our ipp , we were given a new loi this past monday , good for
a week till next monday , 27 aug . , and , it appeared our agreement was to be
with the new agency , capa , ( ca . power authority ) . now , for our benefit , it
is back with dwr , and we have a ppa , in draft form , our developer is working
on with the state people . they , our dev . , has been asked to stay in the
capital till this is signed off on monday which they are doing , staying !
i asked if we could get you a copy of this ppa but we can provide you with
the replacement loi from dwr and we have requested the draft ppa as well .
the moment the ppa is signed the funds will be wired to ena , this we have as
a promise from the ipp and the corporate funding group .
we have demonstrated our dilemma and are doing the best we can .
keep in mind that our ipp is the only one left to end up with a contract .
ten others were not extended .
if you can see your way clear please give us until next week to provide the
funds without changing the end date of 28 sept . extend us one more week .
your thoughtful understanding is greatly appreciated . please feel free to
have brett give us a call so we can personally bring him up to date .
we are doing everything we can to make our client aware of the need to
produce the funds we have committed to and they have given us their
assurance that this will indeed be done at the moment of signing .
it ' s just that the state of ca . really threw us for a loop with this new
agency and back and forth with dwr , and now we are back on board as
originally intended . . just more political posturing .
best regards ,
fred lange

title : cera monthly briefing : supply anxiety
author : n . american natural gas team

as the heating season approaches , a high  * but justified  * level of anxiety
regarding winter supplies is driving the gas market . as things stand , the
market
is headed into the winter exposed to a supply shortfall late in the winter
even
under normal weather conditions . this prospect has placed a floor on the gas
price at the price of residual fuel oil , itself priced in the mid - to upper
$ 4 . 00 s
range . gas prices moving into this range would begin to attract demand back
into the market , diverting supplies from storage and increasing supply
concerns
again . to the upside , there is little demand response to price until
industrial
demand lessens or the price of distillate oil , as of this writing near $ 7 . 00
per
million british thermal units ( mmbtu ) , is breached . however , distillate
markets
themselves are extremely tight , and prices for that fuel would likely follow
gas
prices up . within this range , prices are defined mainly by supply anxiety  * the
market  , s judgment of the likelihood of a supply shortfall , which would be
characterized by extreme pricing and volatility , and a difficult process of
supply
allocation by price .
by now , exposure to extreme price volatility this winter is certain . although
cera expects storage injections to increase by approximately 2 . 0 billion cubic
feet ( bcf ) per day from august to september , this increase would still leave
inventories at record lows for this month and next . even this increase in
injections will not occur if a tropical storm forces evacuation of offshore
platforms , or if hot weather returns .
for october , heating load enters the picture . with us supplies running close
to
year - earlier levels and imports slightly higher , demand priced out of the
market
will remain the key reason that storage injections increase at all from last
year  , s
low level . as a result , although prices may close the month of september in
the
upper $ 4 . 00 s per mmbtu , at the high end of the competitive range with resid ,
any threat of interruption in supplies will quickly bounce prices upward
during
the remainder of september or in october . as the heating season begins ,
therefore , cera expects the reality of supply vulnerability for the winter to
result in the first ever monthly average price of $ 5 . 00 at the henry hub ( see
table 1 ) and the first of potentially many months at or above that price .
gas storage  * new record lows
cera estimates that storage inventories in the united states crossed into
record
low territory as of the end of august , when inventories of 2 , 233 bcf fell
below
the previous 1996 record low of 2 , 245 bcf ( see table 2 ) . more records will
likely be broken in the coming months , and by widening margins . injections for
september are expected to average 9 . 5 bcf per day , an increase of 2 . 0 bcf per
day from the august level but below last year  , s pace of 10 . 3 bcf per day .
cera  , s september estimate could be exceeded under mild weather conditions
with no tropical activity hitting the gulf of mexico , but injections would
likely
fall below the 9 . 5 bcf per day rate should storm activity force evacuation of
platforms . this rate would leave us inventories at 2 , 518 bcf at month  , s end , a
record low by 87 bcf .
for october , cera expects a slight increase in the injection rate from last
year .
injections of 5 . 5 bcf per day on average this year would be enabled by demand
priced out of the market and by a lack of unusually cool weather or tropical
storm activity . october injections have varied historically from 4 . 0 bcf per
day
( 1989 ) to 8 . 5 bcf per day ( 1998 ) . even if injections reached toward the upper
end of this range , the market would remain exposed to shortfalls during the
winter . at the expected injection rate , us inventories of 2 , 689 bcf at the
end of
october would result in an end of march 2001 inventory level of 669 bcf under
normal winter weather , 89 bcf below the previous record low of 758 bcf .
regional markets  * waiting for winter
the pipeline explosion on el paso during late august intensified the
subregional
pressures already at play in western gas markets . cuts in pipeline flows
limited
access into california on the only pipeline route into the state with any
excess
capacity . the lack of supply pressured prices within the supply basins and
forced strong storage withdrawals in the california market . although summer
power loads in california will ease and much of the el paso capacity has been
restored , the race to improve storage positions before the onset of winter
heating
load will keep intense pressure on topock prices . differentials in the rest
of the
west will strengthen as local heating loads begin to absorb enough supply to
ease pipeline bottlenecks ( see table 3 ) .
differentials in the east , which have traded in a narrow range this summer ,
will
likely reach slightly higher levels with the start of the heating season in
october .
however , exposure to pricing disconnects will remain low until later this
year .
cera  , s outlook by region follows :
* rockies . pipeline bottlenecks out of the rocky mountains
this summer should begin to ease as heating loads climb
during october . cera expects that as local demand limits
pressure on pipeline capacity , differentials will narrow .
october differentials should average $ 0 . 50 per mmbtu .
* san juan . the resumption of flows on el paso  , s southern
system , combined with production outages , has relieved
some of the access constraints on san juan supply .
seasonal declines in rockies to southwest flows and the
beginning of the heating season should narrow october
differentials to $ 0 . 35 per mmbtu .
* permian and mid - continent . the continuing pull on
supplies from the west will support permian prices , and the
midwestern pull on supplies will support mid - continent
prices . cera expects a differential to the henry hub of
$ 0 . 06 per mmbtu for mid - continent supplies and $ 0 . 11
per mmbtu for permian supplies .
* chicago . the delay in the in - service date for alliance from
october 2 to october 30 will take some gas out of the
chicago market next month . this delay , combined with the
need to build midwest storage inventories , should sustain
the recent increase in differentials from the $ 0 . 05  ) $ 0 . 08
range to above $ 0 . 10 per mmbtu . cera expects october
differentials at the chicago citygate to average $ 0 . 11 .
* northeast markets . gas prices near $ 5 . 00 have increased
the fuel cost of delivery from the gulf coast into the
northeast , raising the floor level for differentials to near
$ 0 . 30 per mmbtu . the beginning of the heating season and
the lack of new capacity into the new york citygate should
support differentials above the floor during october , at near
$ 0 . 40 per mmbtu .
canadian markets  * outages affect supply
outages have affected supply thus far in september . both british columbia and
alberta have been affected , resulting in a further year - over - year decline in
western canadian supply . the various problems appear to be rectified , but the
average supply for the month is likely to be down 100 to 150 million cubic
feet
( mmcf ) per day from september 1999 .
drilling has been adversely affected over the past several weeks by wet
weather ,
but rig utilization is beginning to climb again to previous levels . more than
8 , 400 gas wells are expected for this year .
slight drop in export demand
eastern canadian demand is still down approximately 200 mmcf per day , with
cooler - than - normal weather reducing the need for air conditioning . in the west
however , cooler - than - normal weather has accounted for an increase in demand
for heating requirements of about 200 mmcf per day .
exports are down slightly in september compared with september 1999 , with
pg & e gt - nw off 110 mmcf per day . northern border is running even with
september 1999 .
storage picture brighter in canada
storage injections in eastern canada have picked up , with inventories now
expected to reach the five - year average of 210 bcf . in the west , inventories
at
the end of the injection season will not only be above the five - year level but
should be even with those of 1999 , at 250 bcf .
wider differentials holding
after widening substantially in august to us $ 1 . 17 , the aeco - to - henry
differential has closed back to a more typical level of $ 0 . 60 in september .
september  , s aeco price should average us $ 4 . 15 per mmbtu ( c $ 5 . 79 per
gigajoule [ gj ] ) , increasing in october to us $ 4 . 35 per mmbtu ( c $ 6 . 07 per gj ) .

hplc continues to purchase gas from both ocean and seneca on a term basis ; firm tickets were submitted for april origination beginning with the month of april . as for as barrett , they are selling their gas under a joa with seneca ; therefore , 100 % of barrett ' s production is being paid to seneca . consequently , you should see tickets in sitara for both counterparties .
let me know is you can ' t .

i don ' t yet have a specific job nailed down for him . i think that he could run a urm desk ( east or west ) . he could run the site profile , asset profile , dsm group . i would expect that he would expect to come in at a vp level . i know that ' s a high bar and hard to do here , which is why i would want this group of people to meet with him . i have asked debra davidson to contact each of you to coordinate these interviews .
thanks ,
tim",ham

( wraps financial - creditquality - moodys and financial - defaults - s & p )
by jonathan stempel
new york , oct 29 ( reuters ) - corporate credit quality will likely grow much worse before it gets better , and about $ 100 billion of corporate debt will likely go into default this year as the united states heads into recession , according to reports issued on monday by two top credit rating agencies .
moody ' s investors service said it put ratings on review for downgrade for 122 u . s . companies with $ 543 billion of debt in the third quarter , dwarfing the 22 companies with $ 66 billion of debt it put on review for upgrade . reviews are a leading indicator of the direction of corporate credit .
"" a wide excess of rating reviews for downgrade over upgrades in the third quarter suggests credit deterioration will persist at least into early next year , "" said john puchalla , moody ' s senior economist .
meanwhile , standard & poor ' s said more than 200 companies will default on about $ 100 billion of debt this year , compared with 117 defaulting on a record $ 42 . 3 billion in 2000 .
it said the default rate for junk bonds - those rated "" bb - plus "" or lower by s & p and "" bal "" or lower by moody ' s because of their credit risks - will reach 9 . 4 percent by year end . moody ' s forecasts a 10 percent rate .
"" the u . s . economy is clearly in a recession , "" said s & p chief economist david wyss in a statement . "" although standard & poor ' s expects it to be relatively mild and end in early 2002 , the risk of a longer and deeper downturn is high . ""
both agencies said the sept . 11 attacks contributed to a deepening of a three - year slump in corporate credit quality . moody ' s blamed 38 reviews for downgrade in september alone on the attacks .
costs rise , protection weakens
u . s . corporate credit quality is falling for many reasons .
these include the weakening economy , the inability of many marginal companies to raise cash at tolerable interest rates , share buybacks , debt - financed merger activity , and fallout from the attacks on such industries as airlines , insurance and travel .
"" many companies in financial difficulties will see their funding sources dry up and be pushed over the brink , "" said david keisman , managing director at s & p risk solutions .
even well - known companies are suffering rating declines .
on monday alone , for example , s & p downgraded mcdonald corp . after the world ' s largest fast - food chain said it will buy back up to $ 5 billion of stock , at a time s & p said the company ' s "" growth prospects for the future are less optimistic . ""
meanwhile , moody ' s downgraded enron corp . , and warned it may downgrade it again . the energy trading giant is struggling with vanishing investor confidence , reflected in a share price that has plunged by more than half in two weeks , as it tries to keep access to cash it needs to run its business .
puchalla said the credit quality decline could slow next year , in part because interest rates are low and companies are managing their balance sheets more conservatively .
"" lower borrowing costs and slowing debt growth should reduce debt servicing costs , and fiscal stimulus from the federal government should boost business revenues , "" he said .
still , through friday , moody ' s has said in the fourth quarter it may downgrade 47 companies , and upgrade just four .

usa : u . s . firms say deals with enron at normal levels .
by andrew kelly
10 / 29 / 2001
reuters english news service
( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
houston , oct 29 ( reuters ) - major u . s . wholesale natural gas and electricity traders said on monday their deals with troubled enron corp . are still running at normal levels .
but some are keeping a wary eye on the company ' s finances and credit status after a downgrade by one of the major rating agencies .
"" we certainly are very well aware of what our exposure is to them and watching that on a daily basis , "" chief executive marce fuller of atlanta energy marketer mirant corp . told reuters .
"" at this point , i would categorize it as pretty much as business as usual with enron , but we ' ll have to keep a close eye on it as we move forward , "" said fuller .
officials at companies such as houston natural gas firm el paso corp . and columbus , ohio , utility holding company american electric power co . inc . expressed similar sentiments , saying nothing had changed in their dealings with the houston - based energy company , at least for the time being .
"" we continue to trade with them , "" said spokeswoman jennifer pierce of charlotte - based utility duke energy corp . . "" they ' ve always been meticulous in their credit management and we continue to see that with them , "" she added .
enron ' s shares fell to yet another new low on monday as the company said it was lobbying banks for a new credit line and rating agency moody ' s investor service downgraded the company ' s senior unsecured debt to two notches above junk - bond status .
since oct . 12 enron ' s stock has fallen some 60 percent after the company reported its first quarterly loss in over four years , wrote down shareholders ' equity by $ 1 . 2 billion dollars and failed to quell investors ' jitters about a series of complex off - balance - sheet financial deals .
confidence crumbles
analysts say that if confidence in enron continued to crumble , it could restrict the company ' s access to credit and thus create problems for its core energy trading operations .
european energy industry sources told reuters earlier on monday that there was already evidence of european companies shying away from trading with enron because of credit worries .
several large energy groups have frozen their dealings with enron in europe as they hold urgent talks with the u . s . group about setting up new credit arrangements , the sources said .
"" they are talking with us about bank letters of credit , "" said the head of risk management at one u . k . utility that halted its trade with enron last week . "" the people that are still trading with them are doing so on a very restrictive basis . ""
traders in the u . s . wholesale energy markets said on monday that they were continuing to deal with enron and still regard the company as a reliable trading partner .
"" i don ' t have any problems dealing with enron , especially since i ' m doing day - ahead trades . but i have heard the rumors of people not wanting to deal with them , "" one natural gas trader in the u . s . southeast told reuters .
a trader who specializes in longer - term deals in the forwards market for electricity said publicity about enron ' s woes had not yet led to any loss of market liquidity .
"" obviously there ' s a concern , but the financial situation is not a factor now , "" the trader said .
despite the public words of reassurance that many of them have been speaking , enron ' s major competitors and trading partners continue to monitor the situation closely .
"" any time a counterparty starts looking like their credit rating is deteriorating , then that would certainly be a signal to us to become more worried , "" said mirant ' s fuller .

enron bonds stabilize but market players are concerned
by michael c . barr

10 / 29 / 2001
capital markets report
( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . )
new york - ( dow jones ) - uncertainty about enron corp . ( ene ) continues to dog investors concerned about the future of the houston - based energy services company .
"" it ' s such a fluid situation that the market would like to see a clarification of the company ' s circumstances , "" said eric bergson , portfolio manager , northern trust global investments , chicago . until this occurs , the outlook for the company ' s bonds is choppy , he added .
enron drew down about $ 3 billion in credit lines last week to increase cash reserves and calm jittery markets , buying back its outstanding commercial paper . and , it ' s currently negotiating with its bank group for an additional $ 1 billion to $ 2 billion in new credit , according to a report in monday ' s wall street journal .
enron ' s troubles began earlier this month with the announcement of a $ 618 million third - quarter loss and the disclosure of a $ 1 . 2 billion erosion of investor equity related to transactions conducted with its former chief financial officer , andrew fastow .
"" the company did not learn from the mistakes of others by not being ahead of the game on disclosure , "" said mitch stapley , portfolio manager and chief fixed income officer , fifth third investment advisors , grand rapids , mich . it becomes harder to regain investors ' trust , he said .
moody ' s investors service lowered the company ' s senior unsecured long - term debt rating monday to baa 2 from baal . the debt is rated triple - b - plus by standard & poor ' s corp . , with a negative outlook . fitch also maintains a triple - b - plus rating and it placed the debt on rating watch negative late last week .
both fitch and moody ' s cited negative investor reaction to recent company developments . and moody ' s added that its "" analysis of the developing situation will focus on management ' s success in lining up further liquidity support and on their ability to retain credit availability from their major counterparties . ""
one money manager said he was concerned "" about the fallout and its impact on the company ' s ability to trade "" energy .
the company ' s bonds already have suffered as a result of the uncertainty . the bonds with a 6 . 40 % coupon maturing in 2006 were offered at a dollar price of 80 on friday . many investors believe that the 80 dollar price point is a demarcation separating high - yield debt from distressed debt levels .
the company ' s bonds improved a little on monday , to about an 83 dollar price .

enron ' s stock continues slide on credit woes

copyright 2001 . the associated press . all rights reserved .
houston ( ap ) - enron corp . ' s stock slid to new lows on monday , pushed down in part by moody ' s investors service announcing a possible downgrade of the company ' s credit rating pending a review .
the downgrade came as enron negotiates with banks to establish new credit lines as the largest u . s . natural gas and power marketing company struggles to bounce back from disappointing third quarter earnings and a scandal over losses stemming from partnerships managed by the company ' s former chief financial officer .
in trading monday afternoon on the new york stock exchange , enron shares were down nearly 9 percent , or dlrs 1 . 38 a share , at dlrs 14 . 02 - their lowest level in nearly seven years . a year ago , enron stock sold at nearly dlrs 85 a share .
enron ' s efforts to acquire more credit came after the houston - based company last week decided to cash in about dlrs 3 billion in revolving credit it has with various banks to shore up investor confidence .
"" we are in discussions about new credit lines , "" enron spokeswoman karen denne said monday . "" we ' re taking action to restore investor and market confidence . ""
denne would not disclose how much credit the company was seeking . but the wall street journal quoted unidentified sources who said the amount is between dlrs 1 billion and dlrs 2 billion and that the deal is close to being completed .
denne said of the dlrs 3 billion in credit enron cashed in last week , dlrs 2 billion of it was used to pay short term debt . currently , there are no plans for the other dlrs 1 billion , she said .
moody ' s on monday placed all of enron ' s long term debt obligations on review for downgrade , citing "" substantially reduced valuations in several of its businesses . ""
on oct . 16 , enron reported a net loss of dlrs 638 million in the third quarter , taking a one - time charge of dlrs 1 . 01 billion attributed to investment losses , troubled assets and unit restructurings .
enron ' s stock was hammered over the next week as it became apparent some of those losses were tied to partnerships managed by enron ' s former chief financial officer , andrew fastow .
concerns about a potential conflict of interest touched off an inquiry by the securities and exchange commission .
enron ousted fastow last week .
moody ' s said in a press release the "" magnitude of the announced charges will reduce enron ' s equity base and increase nominal financial leverage to somewhat over 50 percent while slashing earnings . ""

new york , oct 29 ( reuters ) - energy trading giant enron corp . , its shares in a new free - fall to near seven - year lows , said on monday it is seeking additional credit to bolster investor confidence after tapping about $ 3 billion in credit last week .
enron , the nation ' s biggest energy trader , declined to comment on the size of the credit line , which banks it is in talks with or when it expects to complete an agreement on the new credit line .
"" we want to restore investor and market confidence and nothing instills confidence like cash , "" said enron spokesman mark palmer in houston , referring to company efforts to secure new credit .
company shares again tumbled on monday , shedding $ 1 . 57 , or 10 . 13 percent , to $ 13 . 93 in midday trade on the new york stock exchange . once a wall street darling , the stock has tumbled more than half in price since enron released earnings two weeks ago , losing about $ 15 . 1 billion in market capitalization as investors fretted about the transparency of off - balance sheet transactions .
moody ' s investors service on monday cut enron ' s senior unsecured debt rating to two notches above junk status , and warned it may cut it again , as well as its rating for enron ' s commercial paper . rating agency standard & poor ' s on thursday revised its outlook for enron ' s ratings to "" negative "" from "" stable . ""
enron ' s credit - worthiness has a direct affect on the price it pays to take out loans , and the perception among its trading partners on the company ' s ability to make good on trades .
moody ' s said enron is suffering from deteriorating financial flexibility since it announced big write - downs and equity charges from previously undisclosed partnership investments . it said this triggered "" difficulties in rolling over commercial paper . ""
industry sources on monday said several large energy companies in europe are shying away from trading with enron amid concerns about the company ' s credit status .
sign of weakness
enron shares have tumbled since the company reported its first - quarterly loss in more than four years on oct . 16 . the company also wrote down $ 1 . 2 billion in equity , including transactions with partnerships formerly run by its chief financial officer who was forced to step down from enron last week .
the sell - off was sparked by investor concern about the transparency of the transactions , which the securities and exchange commission is examining . enron last week replaced cfo andrew fastow as part of efforts to restore investor confidence .
the wall street journal reported monday the size of the credit line enron is negotiating is between $ 1 billion to $ 2 billion . enron said it drew down about $ 3 billion in credit lines last week , and has a net cash liquid position in excess of $ 1 billion .
however , many industry observes see the request by enron , which has about $ 63 . 4 billion in energy assets , for an additional credit as a sign of weakness .
"" clearly , both the stock and bond market view enron as being in dire straits , "" said independent research firm gimme credit analyst carol levenson , who specializes in high grade corporate bonds .
"" we are not of the opinion that drawing down all of one ' s backup bank lines is a demonstration of financial strength , but instead it ' s an act of desperation . ""

( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
new york , oct 29 ( reuters ) - a collapse of market
confidence could hurt the credit quality of energy trading
giant enron corp . , but its bonds are not likely to end
up in junk territory , fixed - income research service gimmecredit
said on monday .
moreover , enron ' s bonds could be undervalued if the
company ' s off - balance - sheet obligations amount to no more
than $ 3 billion , as reported , gimmecredit said .
"" worst case , enron doesn ' t look like a junk credit , ""
gimmecredit analyst carol levenson said . "" but perception is
all , and clearly both the stock and bond markets view enron
as being in dire straits . ""
enron ' s bonds fell sharply on friday after the energy
giant drew down about $ 3 billion from a credit line and
said it was in talks with its banks to obtain a new
multibillion - dollar credit line .
the company ' s stock has lost more than half of its
value in the last two weeks as investors questioned
off - balance - sheet transactions between the company and two
limited partnerships run by former chief financial officer
andrew fastow . the u . s . securities and exchange commission
is looking into those transactions for possible conflicts
of interest .
"" we admit management ' s financial disclosure remains
woefully inadequate , "" gimmecredit said . "" however , botched
investor communication does not necessarily equate to
illegal or fraudulent behavior . ""
still , enron ' s move last week to draw down all of its
backup bank lines was "" an act of desperation , "" gimmecredit
said . the move eventually may lead to renegotiated bank
agreements , which could be more expensive and restrictive
and could also subordinate the position of bondholders , it
said .
"" on the plus side is our belief that management will do
everything in their power to preserve the company ' s
investment - grade ratings , "" the firm said .
another positive is a precedent the rating agencies set
with kmart corp . in the mid - 1990 s , when they tried to avoid
being the cause of a company ' s financial downfall , gimmecredit
said .
moody ' s investors service on monday cut enron ' s senior
unsecured rating to "" baa 2 "" from "" baal "" and kept it on
review for further downgrade . moody ' s said its actions were
prompted by deterioration in enron ' s financial flexibility
since the company announced significant write - downs and
equity charges in previously undisclosed partnership
investments .
last thursday , standard & poor ' s revised its outlook on
enron to negative while affirming its "" bbb - plus "" long - term
rating .

new york , oct 29 ( reuters ) - enron corp . shares fell to their lowest level in almost seven years in early trade on monday following news that north america ' s largest natural gas and electricity trader was considering tapping additional credit lines to ease financial concerns that have sent its stock slumping more than 50 percent in the past two weeks .
enron shares were down $ 1 . 55 , or 10 percent , to $ 13 . 95 on the new york stock exchange . the shares have not been under $ 14 since december 1994 .
earlier , the credit - rating agency moody ' s investor service placed all long term - debt obligations of enron under review for downgrade following the company ' s announcement of significant write - downs and charges , reflecting substantially reduced valuations in several of its businesses .
moody ' s said the actions affect enron ' s broadband operations , its merchant portfolio , and the azurix water company holdings .
last week enron shares lost almost $ 14 billion in market value as a series of piecemeal disclosures about the company ' s involvement in complex partnerships began to trickle out .
many industry observers see enron ' s request for additional credit , after the company tapped its banks for $ 3 . 3 billion last week , as a sign a weakness .

new york ( afx ) - moody ' s investors service said it placed all the long - term debt obligations of enron on review for downgrade following the company ' s announcement of significant write - downs and charges , reflecting substantially reduced valuations in several of its businesses .
the magnitude of the announced charges will reduce enron ' s equity base and increase nominal financial leverage to somewhat over 50 pct while slashing earnings , moody ' s said in a statement .
the company ' s previously announced sale of portland general , however , will result in cash proceeds approximating 1 . 8 bln usd which management is earmarking for debt reduction . in addition , the sale will remove approximately 1 bln usd of debt obligations from enron ' s balance sheet .
however , moody ' s noted that , while this transaction will go a long way to help restore enron ' s balance sheet , it requires regulatory approval and is likely to take up to a year to complete .
enron has a baal senior unsecured rating .

enron shares fall after moody ' s cuts credit rating ( update 6 )
2001 - 10 - 29 16 : 46 ( new york )
enron shares fall after moody ' s cuts credit rating ( update 6 )
( adds bondholder quote and background on commercial paper . )
new york , oct . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . shares declined
a ninth day as moody ' s investors service lowered its credit
rating , raising concern the largest energy trader would be cut off
from raising the cash it needs to fund day - to - day operations .
moody ' s lowered enron ' s senior unsecured long - term debt
ratings to ` ` baa 2 , ' ' two levels above junk , from ` ` baal ' ' and also
placed the houston - based company ' s ` ` p - 2 ' ' rating for commercial
paper on review for downgrade .
moody ' s may downgrade enron ' s commercial paper rating , which
would make it harder for the firm to borrow the short - term cash
needed to run its trading businesses . ahead of a potential cut ,
enron took out bank lines to repay $ 2 billion in commercial paper
last week , largely removing itself from that borrowing arena .
` ` they ' ve pretty much already written off coming to the
commercial - paper market , ' ' said shannon bass , who holds enron
bonds in the $ 50 million he helps manage at pacific investment
management co . ` ` the real issue now is trying to get their house
in order . ' '
pimco is ` ` well underweight ' ' enron bonds relative to bond
benchmarks the portfolios are matched to , bass said .
shut out
companies such as xerox corp . , which was shut out of the
commercial - paper market a year ago before its credit ratings were
reduced , were forced to borrow on bank credit lines to access
cash . investors in commercial paper , borrowings due in nine months
or less , also stopped buying motorola inc . and lucent technologies
inc . short - term debt , forcing the firms to restructure borrowing ,
sell assets , and find alternative financing sources that typically
cost more .
enron shares plunged $ 1 . 59 , or 10 percent , to $ 13 . 81 ,
continuing a slide that dates back to oct . 17 , when enron reported
$ 1 . 01 billion in losses from investments outside its business of
energy trading .
the stock traded near $ 90 in september 2000 and touched a
seven - year low of $ 13 . 55 today . enron has lost more than $ 50
billion in market value this year . on dec . 31 , the company had a
market capitalization of $ 62 . 7 billion . today , the market value
was $ 10 . 5 billion .
deterioration
while enron shares have sank about 60 percent in a week , its
bonds are down about 20 percent . a company ' s stock typically falls
faster than its debt because bondholders have first claim on
assets after bank loans are paid .
the company ' s 6 . 4 percent bonds maturing in 2006 fell 4 cents
to 80 cents on the $ 1 of face value after the moody ' s downgrade .
yields have risen to 12 . 1 percent , up from 10 . 8 before that
downgrade , traders said . the bonds were trading at 100 cents the
week before .
moody ' s said the cut was prompted by the ` ` deterioration in
enron ' s financial flexibility ' ' since the write - downs and charges .
the partnership investments had not been disclosed before this
month , which ` ` led to a substantial loss in investor confidence , ' '
according to moody ' s .
` ` a credit downgrade will be punitive as far as their
borrowing power , ' ' said joe correnti , who follows enron for wayne
hummer investments llc in chicago . ` ` that ' s not a good place for
them to be . they have somewhat aggressive expansion plans . ' '
enron ' s recent woes had many investors factoring in a credit -
rating reduction . ` ` this move was anticipated , ' ' said mike dineen ,
who holds enron bonds in the $ 5 billion of fixed - income assets he
helps manage at mony life insurance co .
there are about $ 15 . 8 billion of enron bonds outstanding ,
almost $ 9 billion of which comes due between 2003 and 2006 ,
according to bloomberg data .
cash needed
last week , enron ousted chief financial officer andrew fastow
after the u . s . securities and exchange commission asked for
information about transactions he conducted for partnerships he
headed . in august , jeff skilling quit as enron chief executive ,
eight months after taking the position , and chairman ken lay moved
back into the position .
enron is trying to get $ 1 billion to $ 2 billion in loans from
citigroup inc . , j . p . morgan chase & co . and other banks to calm
investors , the wall street journal reported . the company ' s stock
has plummeted 57 percent since oct . 17 , when fastow ' s partnerships
were disclosed .
enron uses its investment - grade credit rating to borrow money
for the cash it needs every day to settle commodities trades and
to keep trading partners .
` ` when you act as a middleman you need high credit ratings .
it ' s likely their trading volumes will go down ' ' as other energy
and financial firms seek higher - rated trading partners , said sean
egan , managing director at egan - jones ratings co . , which gives
enron ' s credit a junk grade of ` ` bb + . ' '
enron ' s long - term ratings outlook was changed last week to
negative from stable by standard & poor ' s . s & p affirmed the firm ' s
rating of ` ` bbb + ' ' , the equivalent of moody ' s ` ` baal ' ' .
` ` we have been split - rated before and it did not affect our
growth , ' ' said karen denne , a spokeswoman for houston - based enron .
` ` we are still investment grade . ' '
enron ' s lenders to demand harsher terms , analysts say ( update 2 )

enron ' s lenders to demand harsher terms , analysts say ( update 2 )
( updates with closing share price in last paragraph . )
houston , oct . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . , which can ' t get
low - interest , short - term loans , faces skeptical lenders who will
demand increasingly harsher terms as the largest energy trader
tries to get cash in the bank , credit analysts said .
` ` anyone providing new funding is going to be nervous , ' ' said
sean egan , managing director at egan - jones ratings co . ` ` it ' s
likely that lenders are going to demand collateral . ' '
enron is trying to get $ 1 billion to $ 2 billion in loans from
citigroup inc . , j . p . morgan chase & co . and other banks to calm
investors after a 52 percent drop in the company ' s stock since
oct . 17 , the wall street journal reported . the company needs cash
every day to settle commodities transactions and to keep trading
partners .
the company on thursday tapped $ 3 . 3 billion in bank credit
lines last week to pay off about $ 2 billion in commercial paper ,
or short - term corporate loans . a week ago , the enron said the u . s .
securities and exchange commission had began an inquiry into
related - party transactions . they cost the company $ 35 million and
$ 1 . 2 billion in lost shareholder equity .
` ` banks are in the driver ' s seat , and enron is a little
desperate , ' ' said peter petas , a debt analyst at creditsights inc .
` ` i think their interest rates for loans would go up . ' '
sells assets for cash
companies in enron ' s situation often agree to other bank
terms in order to secure loans , petas said . those can include
agreeing to use proceeds from selling assets to pay debt and
putting up assets as collateral .
enron is attempting to sell assets to raise cash . two related
partnerships , osprey and marlin , depend on selling power plants
and similar assets to repay $ 3 . 3 billion borrowed to buy the
plants . enron may have to pay any difference between the debt and
sales proceeds .
the company plans to complete the $ 2 . 9 billion sale of
portland general electric , an oregon utility , to northwest natural
gas co . next year .
shares of houston - based enron fell $ 1 . 59 , or 10 percent , to
$ 13 . 81 . the stock has tumbled 82 percent in the past 12 months .

moody ' s downgrades enron ' s debt

10 / 29 / 01
new york ( cbs . mw ) - shares of enron fell further monday after moody ' s investors service downgraded enron ' s long - term debt a notch .
enron , which hit a 52 - week high of $ 84 . 88 on dec . 29 , was well on its way to another year low monday . heading for a ninth straight day of losses , enron shed more than 9 percent , or $ 1 . 41 , to $ 13 . 99 . the stock was again the most active mover on the new york stock exchange as close to 28 million shares had changed hands .
moody ' s said it cut the senior unsecured long - term debt to baa 2 from baal , and the ratings remain on review for potential additional downgrades . the action follows enron ' s reported $ 1 . 01 billion charge in the third quarter and was driven by the expectation of further write - downs and the swift deterioration of the company ' s financial picture , said stephen moore , vice president at moody ' s .
"" however , we do feel the move enron made to draw down their revolvers to pay off their commercial paper was a smart business move , "" said stephen moore , vice president at moody ' s . the rating agency said it would review the prime - 2 rating on enron ' s commercial paper .
last thursday , enron announced it had tapped its lines of credit to provide more than $ 1 billion in cash liquidity and that would it use $ 2 billion to pay down commercial paper .
the decision to pay off the commercial paper , he said , accomplishes two goals .
"" it increases liquidity on a short - term basis , and additionally , it enables them to focus on other areas they need to focus on right now , "" moore said . "" they are working on setting up an additional facility for further capital to support their wholesale trading business . ""
karen denne , an enron spokesperson , confirmed monday that the company is in discussions with banks for further financing . additional credit would help boost enron ' s liquidity position .
the lingering concern for moody ' s is that there "" yet may be something else out there that gets to the credibility issue of enron itself , "" moore said .
at the heart of the credibility issue are two limited partnerships - - lmj and lmj 2 - created in 1999 by former cfo andy fastow and since dissolved . enron ousted fastow last week . see related story . "" the market was unaware , "" of the existence of the partnerships , moore said .
"" quite frankly , we don ' t think there is anything else , "" he said . "" but enron is huge , and if this could happen . . . there is a lingering concern that something else might happen . we cannot confirm or deny that this is true . we will be meeting soon with them to resolve issues such as these . ""
moore said the meeting could come as soon as this week .
"" should the wholesale trading business and the counterparties therein become impacted by these events , that could lead to the slowing growth of the wholesale business , the enron engine , "" he said .
moody ' s action monday also negatively affected the ratings on two trusts - - marlin water trust and osprey , which have combined debt of $ 3 . 2 billion . marlin is now rated baa 2 , while osprey carries a new rating of baa 3 , both down a notch .
the potential issue for the trusts may be "" how much equity enron would have to issue if the sale of the underlying assets alone isn ' t enough to pay off the debt . "" enron is anticipating using the proceeds from the sale of assets to meet its obligation .

enron goes begging
forbes . com staff , forbes . com , 10 . 29 . 01 , 11 : 40 am et
new york - enron said this morning that it is in talks with banks for additional credit , as declining investor confidence sent its stock to a six - year low and several large energy groups put their dealings with enron on hold . last thursday , the energy trader drew down about $ 3 billion from a credit line , causing its bonds to fall sharply on friday .
enron ( nyse : ene ) has been scrambling to reassure investors and business partners since oct . 16 - - after the company reported its first quarterly loss in more than four years . the $ 638 million loss included $ 1 . 01 billion in charges on ill - fated investments . a week later , it disclosed that the u . s . securities and exchange commission had asked for information on partnerships run by chief financial officer andrew fastow and other executives . fastow was forced to step down from the company last week .
the turmoil makes it clearer than ever that enron ' s problems weren ' t solved by the recent departure of chief executive jeffrey skilling .
in these challenging times , enron deserves our thanks
houston chronicle , october 28 , 2001
by bill white
enron and its employees have blessed houston , and many houstonians should now take the time to say "" thanks "" when the company has experienced some highly publicized challenges . enron attracted thousands of great people to houston and changed houston ' s economy forever . the company ' s management encouraged their employees to be active citizens , and those folks responded by making a big difference in their community .
enron ' s lead in shaping a nationwide market for electricity gave birth to a multibillion - dollar new industry , with houston as its hub . even while it competed hard to win in the marketplace , enron ' s example helped show other natural gas pipeline and trading firms how to move into the even bigger market of electricity . the downtown concentration of these firms - - industry leaders including reliant , dynegy , el paso and duke energy - - led london ' s financial times to refer to louisiana street as the wall street of electricity .
this explosive growth attracted bright young people - - with the average age of enron employees at under 35 - - and they in turn helped fuel an explosion in residential growth in houston ' s downtown . this , in turn , helped revitalize downtown ' s retail and restaurant scene . enron ' s construction of a large class a office tower , still going up , is a milestone in houston ' s growth , an official end to more than a decade of large amounts of vacant office space .
virtually every civic or charitable activity in houston learned to count on enron for both financial support and thousands of hours of invaluable volunteer activities . if enron or its chairman , ken lay , led a visionary effort , such as hosting the meeting of g 7 trade ministers , or more recently the private funding of the houston biotechnology center , houstonians knew it would be done right . without lay our town would have lost major league baseball and status as a big league town .
employees know enron set a standard for hiring and promoting employees based on their potential , with no glass ceilings . women have run large divisions and subsidiaries . many military officers find that enron called on their talents after illustrious military careers , even at ages well past normal corporate entry level . the most highly recruited young people flock to a company that invests heavily in their training and then lets them rise as far and fast as their talent and ability to work hard would allow them .
enron ' s corporate success reflects the stories of so many of its employees who have lived the american dream . with the habits of work learned on a family farm in missouri , ken lay got an education ending with a graduate degree at the university of houston , served his country in government and began a career in the gas pipeline business . when northern natural gas acquired the smaller houston natural gas , northern ' s chairman surprised folks by installing lay as his successor . i was at northern ' s headquarters in omaha the week after the merger 16 years ago when northern ' s chairman reassured folks that they could count on "" best young executive in the business , ken lay , "" to direct their future in a changing marketplace . within 15 years , most of enron ' s revenues and profits came from businesses that did not even exist when lay had taken over , all of which had been created from within the firm . this success did not diminish the farm boy decency and sense of fairness that attracted top talent to his team .
enron rewarded innovation , while many firms afraid to alter the old formula wondered why their leadership eroded . year after year , top executives throughout the country voted enron our nation ' s most innovative corporation . enron recognized , even when financial markets do not , that innovative firms are secure enough to accept occasional failure and the inevitable price of other successes .
rather than seeking insulation from the international marketplace , as had many american businesses , enron welcomed the challenge of the international market , confident that american firms could compete and win . enron also welcomed the challenge of responsible environmental stewardship , and called on industry to address the issue of global warming even as some companies feared the impact of pollution control on their bottom line .
enron ' s phenomenal success created incredible and perhaps unreasonable expectations , as early this year when the stock market valued the company based on 20 percent annual growth , forever . enron ' s size and success made it a convenient target for politicians in california and india , even as enron supplied the electricity they so needed . sometimes it seemed the company ' s upstart origins as the david battling utility goliaths delayed the firm ' s perception that it had won and no longer played the role of an underdog .
and so if enron experiences problems , it will learn from them , just as strong people do . let ' s not prejudge enron ' s current challenges . the more than a decade of my life that was dedicated to trying cases against companies who hurt consumers and investors taught me both to insist on the truth but never to jump to premature conclusions based on a headline or a news story .
throughout its years of success , enron folks have never forgotten to find so many ways to make the firm ' s hometown of houston a better place to live and work . as enron enters a new phase of its life , let ' s not forget to express thanks and steady support .

"please read brian ' s memo below . we spoke briefly about this yesterday in the
staff meeting . i have copied each of you on a memo earlier today where i
have provide the 2000 plan allocations . please note that we were not making
changes to the plan , only breaking the gas asset group into smaller buckets .
any chnages which have been made since the budget was approved are not
reflected on the allocation sheet . rather they are reflected on the 1 / 00
allocations , and they will require explanations each month as all variances
from plan do . this includes new rc ' s which have set up , etc .
i need each of you to review the 2000 plan allocations as i submitted them
earlier today , and provide an accurate allocation of your rc for 1 / 00 . what
has your group spent their time on in 1 / 00 ? ? ? please be aware that we could
receive questions from the commercial teams , so document your logic . some
things to consider :
project sally - allocate to gas network development
project hurricane - allocate to ? ? ? ? - ( i have a call into jim coffey )
denver business - allocate to rocky mountain asset originations
if you have some other activities and your not sure where to allocate them ,
either call me , jackie nelson or jim coffey .
one other thing to note : the network trading group will be further broken
down into 2 groups : trading ( tom martin and jim schwieger ) and
transportation ( ed gottlob ) . although the attached worksheet does not
include this breakdown , please include it in yours .
i would like you allocations back to me no later than thursday , 1 / 20 @
3 : 00 pm . thanks .

subject : 2000 plan allocations and january allocations
the attached files contain the allocation percentages for 2000 plan , january
2000 actuals and a description of the new assets teams .
please update the 2000 plan file to reflect the following changes to the
assets team . the assets team is now broken out into the following "" groups ""
which are described in the attached word document :
rc # team name rc owner
the 2000 plan file now has columns for the above teams , please take the
percentage that was previously allocatated to assets ( which is in the
executive column ) and reallocate it among all of the teams except rocky
mountain asset originations that you support . i have already inserted the
new percentages to be used for rocky mountain , which are based on a portion
of the upstream origination allocation that was determined by the assets
group . consequently i have changed the allocation percentage for upstream
origination . i have also protected all of the cells except the ones you need
to change to avoid confusion .
i also need you to update the percentages to be used for january 2000
actuals . i have added the new rc ' s that we have set up since plan has been
complete , so please make sure you have each rc 100 % allocated .
i will need the updated plan percentages returned to me by noon wednesday
january 19 th , and the updated january 2000 percentages returned to me by end
of day friday january 21 st .
thanks for your help in getting these updated .

"my two cents . . . .
i viewed the goal of the management committee as three - fold
1 . measure management skill
2 . ensure people with superior mgmt skills are appropriately recognized .
3 . ensure best talent ( however defined ) are retained and have mgmt skills nurtured .
to expand on ( 1 ) , ask the questions :
( a ) what attributes characterize a good manager ? from louise ' s list , i would vote for internal alliances and experience .
( b ) how can these be quantified , if at all ?
to expand on ( 2 ) , identify promotion / other opportunities for such people .
the last powerpoint slide is complementing all the discussions so far , but definite goals for the committee were not clear to me - - - do we need to expand on the points on the slide ( i . e . why enron is ahead of other companies , etc . ) ? will we now focus on meritocracy in general and not so much on management itself ?

"network world fusion focus : amy larsen decarlo
on storage in the enterprise
today ' s focus : the lure of the san
03 / 14 / 00
dear wincenty kaminski ,
today ' s focus : the lure of the san
by amy larsen decarlo
e - business is changing how businesses value information . information
has become a strategic asset that gives companies an edge over their
market rivals . companies use intelligence to identify new markets and
make contact with prospective customers . in this media - saturated era ,
information itself is packaged and sold as a product . this makes the
ability to supply users with fast access to stored information on a
continuous basis absolutely crucial .
companies are clearly coming to a crossroads in their storage
implementations . with estimates for internet storage capacity needs
doubling every three months , it professionals are hungry for a scalable
solution to help them consolidate control of stored information . they
often look to storage - area networks ( san ) as a better option to manage
their information storage systems than distributed models .
today , most organizations rely on a distributed storage model that uses
file servers to process i / o requests from end users and other
application servers . in this model , all requests for data go through
the file server that owns the attached storage disks , and only one file
server can tap data on a particular disk via a scsi bus .
this model has several shortcomings . first , the amount of data a
server can access is restricted to the number of disks supported by the
bus , which limits the capacity of a single file server . second , because
the server processes each i / o request , it risks becoming a bottleneck .
third , this server model carries some daunting availability limitations ,
because only one file server is allowed to access a set of disks . if
that file server or any of its scsi connections fails , then users and
other application servers lose access to the stored files .
this model carries other major disadvantages . distributed file servers
rely on the data transport network to run backup and recovery operations
which can eat up bandwidth and slow normal network transmissions to a
crawl . finally , this decentralized setup is difficult to manage from
both a logical and a physical perspective . file server based storage
systems are distributed throughout the enterprise , so it is often
difficult to assess current and future capacity needs . and because
these servers use a parallel cabling scheme to link the file server to
the disk array , they can also be cumbersome to set up and manage .
sans promise to mitigate the problems that plague conventional file
servers , largely through consolidation of control . these specialized
storage networks claim higher availability , faster performance ,
centralized management , and by their architecture , the capability to
remove bandwidth - intensive data backup and recovery operations from the
lan . this frees up the lan for normal data communications and ensures
smoother back - up operations .
using high - speed transports like fibre channel , sans offer a high -
performance network optimized for moving storage data . sans also make
way for new storage implementations like lan - free backup . and , because
fibre channel can support distances of up to 10 kilometers , san devices
can be widely distributed , but also centrally managed as one network .
yet , as was the case with lans in their younger years , sans are still
developing . vendors are still working out major product interoperability
issues , while companies deploying san technology struggle with how to
merge the very different worlds of storage and networks and manage both
together . ultimately the hope is that , like lans , sans will develop into
a mature and highly manageable solution that supplies substantial
benefits at lower costs .
given that storage deployment and ongoing support costs can total 10
times the acquisition price for the equipment , the consolidated
management capabilities of a san may deliver the biggest benefit to
business .

this resume looks quite good . we may wish to talk to him on the phone .
however , now that david hoog has hired his own actuarial guys ( alex

( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
new york , oct 16 ( reuters ) - energy and mining companies have provided a few glimmers of light but otherwise third - quarter results on monday and tuesday are helping to fulfill expectations for the worst quarter in 10 years .
technology bellwethers intel corp . and international business machines corp . , which reported sharply lower profits , did little to buck the downward trend .
firstenergy corp . , an owner of electric utilities in northern ohio and western pennsylvania , on tuesday reported a better - than - expected 18 percent increase in earnings , citing increased electricity sales and lower costs . mining company freeport - mcmoran copper & gold inc . reported a third - quarter profit that reversed a year - earlier loss , due to higher gold production .
yet such good news is proving more the exception than the rule . top chipmaker intel said on tuesday after the close of exchanges that profits tumbled 77 percent as it suffered from slowing global economies and weak personal computer sales . pc maker ibm announced its first quarterly earnings decline since the end of 1999 as weak sales continued to weigh on profits .
energy giant enron corp . posted a quarterly loss after taking $ 1 . 01 billion in charges . companies from a range of industries reported profit shortfalls , including caterpillar inc . , the world ' s largest maker of construction equipment , and unisys corp . , a computer company .
"" the earnings season is one that the market has digested and in some cases predigested as being just ugly , and therefore horrible or ugly results are not met with surprise at this point , "" said michael holland , who runs the $ 65 million holland balanced fund .
focus not on earnings
"" the focus ( for investors ) has been and continues to be outside of earnings , that is , the war on terrorism specifically , "" he said .
dynegy inc . , a natural gas and power marketer and trader , on monday said third - quarter earnings rose 62 percent as its backbone wholesale energy business nearly doubled its returns . while enron posted a loss , it reported that its profit excluding charges rose 35 percent due to strong performance in its core energy business .
"" energy companies manage to earn pretty good money even when prices are down , "" said jon burnham , portfolio manager for the $ 170 million burnham fund . "" these are good , well - financed companies . ""
caterpillar helped to lead a litany of earnings woes . the peoria , illinois - based company on tuesday said its third - quarter earnings fell 5 percent because of higher expenses and less efficient manufacturing .
the company also said it expects fourth - quarter revenues to be down slightly from the year - ago quarter , with full - year profit down 10 percent to 15 percent . it blamed economic uncertainty in the wake of last month ' s attacks for the expected shortfall , but added that 2002 sales will be at least flat to up slightly from 2001 levels .
unisys on monday reported its third - quarter profits plunged by 50 percent due to weakening demand for high - end server computers and systems integration work . it said it would cut 3 , 000 jobs and slashed its fourth - quarter outlook .
taking grim tidings in stride
other companies that have reported profit drops include novellus systems inc . , a maker of semiconductor production equipment , and charles schwab corp . , the top u . s . discount brokerage . schwab said tuesday that quarterly earnings fell 51 percent as customers avoided stocks all summer , although a surge in september trading pointed to better times ahead .
money managers are taking the grim profit tidings in stride .
"" most of these earnings situations are in these stocks , "" said burnham . "" barring unforeseens in the national and international situation , the market should work its way higher over the next 6 to 9 months . ""
"" whatever earnings are in this quarter isn ' t going to matter too much , except in cases where they ' re considerably better than expected or worse , "" he said .
this week is the busiest for earnings with 15 dow jones industrial average and 180 standard & poor ' s 500 index companies scheduled to report .
profits for the companies in the index are expected to shrink by 22 . 8 percent , according to market research firm first call / thomson financial , making it the worst quarter since the second quarter of 1991 . that ' s down from an expected 6 . 2 percent decline at the beginning of the quarter , and a 14 . 7 percent drop expected on sept . 10 , said first call analyst joe cooper .
some 85 s & p 500 companies so far have reported quarterly results . of these , 50 companies have beaten the most recent , often lowered wall street expectations while 26 have matched and nine have missed forecasts .

houston , oct 16 ( reuters ) - energy giant enron corp . said on tuesday it is reviewing strategic options for its loss - making broadband telecommunications business , which could involve selling the business or finding a partner .
"" in addition to us looking at our business on a standalone business , we clearly have entertained some discussions on other possibilities , "" chief executive officer ken lay told reuters in a telephone interview .
earlier on tuesday , enron reported that one - time charges of $ 1 . 01 billion for broadband and other businesses outside its core energy operations pushed the company to a third - quarter net loss of $ 638 million , its first quarterly loss in more than four years .
future options for the broadband business include "" sale , partnership , all kinds of possibilities "" he said .
"" we still think over time that it will be a valuable business , "" lay said , but for now the broadband market is in a "" total meltdown "" , he added .
enron ' s broadband unit , which owns an 18 , 000 mile network , posted a loss of $ 80 million for the third quarter , but lay said losses should be smaller in subsequent quarters .
enron launched its broadband business last year , predicting that network capacity would one day be traded like natural gas or electricity , but it has recently admitted that it overestimated the market ' s early potential and has scaled down its operations .
enron ' s stock rose by 87 percent last year , driven by enthusiasm for the broadband plans and the success of the enrononline internet energy and commodity trading platform .
but the stock has fallen some 59 percent so far this year as sentiment toward the broadband project soured , ceo jeff skilling resigned after only six months in the job and wrangling continued over enron ' s stalled dabhol power plan project in india .
enron shares on tuesday closed up 67 cents , or 2 . 02 percent , at $ 33 . 84 .

( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
washington , oct 16 ( reuters ) - enron corp . on tuesday reported its first loss in more than four years after taking $ 1 . 01 billion in charges on ill - fated investments , including water and telecommunications services , which it said have clouded the strength of its core energy businesses .
enron , north america ' s biggest marketer and trader of natural gas and power , said the charges were an attempt to put its house in order after a tumultuous year in which a new chief executive suddenly resigned and the company ' s stock lost two - thirds of its value as once enthusiastic investors lost faith in the company .
"" what we ' ve tried to do here is clean up anything that we thought needed cleaning up to get these distractions out of the way , "" chief executive officer ken lay said in a conference call .
lay reassumed the ceo mantle at enron after his successor , jeff skilling , resigned in august after only six months at the helm .
houston - based enron reported a third - quarter net loss of $ 638 million , or 84 cents a share , compared with net income of $ 271 million , or 34 cents a share , in the same period of 2000 . it was enron ' s first loss since the second quarter of 1997 .
the charges covered the company ' s loss - making broadband telecommunications business , its troubled water affiliate azurix , and new power co . , enron ' s retail electricity joint - venture with aol / time warner and ibm .
commerzbank securities analyst andre meade said it would probably take enron a few more quarters to rebuild confidence in the company which was a wall street favorite just 12 months ago .
"" they do a couple of things very well and if they stick to their knitting , they ' re a solid company , but they have stumbled when they strayed further afield , "" said meade .
enron ' s stock closed 67 cents higher at $ 33 . 84 on tuesday , but for the year it is down about 59 percent , underperforming the standard & poor ' s utilities index . spu ) , which has fallen some 23 percent over the same period .
ill - fated businesses
originally a natural gas pipeline operator , enron seized on opportunities created by the deregulation of u . s . energy markets to become the nation ' s dominant wholesale marketer and trader of natural gas and electricity .
the company moved into the water services business in 1998 by acquiring britain ' s wessex water and forming azurix , a unit which enron took public in 1999 but had to buy back this year after it failed to meet performance targets and its stock price tumbled .
enron helped set up new power co . and take it public last year but its stock has since fallen from about $ 28 per share to less than $ 2 as companies have found it hard to make a profit in deregulated u . s . residential electricity markets .
enron also launched a broadband telecommunications business last year , predicting that network capacity would one day be traded like natural gas or electricity , but it has recently admitted that it overestimated the market ' s early potential .
enron ' s stock soared past sector peers last year when it posted a gain of 87 percent , driven by enthusiasm for the broadband plans and the success of its enrononline internet energy and commodity trading platform .
but the stock has fallen sharply this year as broadband sentiment soured , skilling resigned and wrangling continued over enron ' s stalled dabhol power plan project in india .
enron ' s third - quarter earnings before one - time charges rose to $ 393 million , or 43 cents a share , from $ 292 million , or 34 cents a share , meeting analysts ' expectations of 42 to 45 cents a share , according to thomson financial / first call .
the company reaffirmed its previously stated earnings targets of 45 cents a share for the fourth quarter , $ 1 . 80 for all of 2001 and $ 2 . 15 for all of 2002 .
debt on credit review
rating agency moody ' s investors service on tuesday said it had placed all of enron ' s long - term debt obligations on review for a possible downgrade . the writedowns would reduce enron ' s equity base , increase its nominal financial leverage and materially impact its earnings , moody ' s said .
enron ' s third - quarter earnings report showed that income at its wholesale marketing and trading division , the company ' s backbone moneymaker , grew 28 percent .
the division , which deals primarily in electricity and natural gas , saw pretax income rise to $ 754 million from $ 589 million in the third quarter of 2000 .
all of the income growth in the segment came from enron ' s gas and power trading and marketing operations in the americas , where income grew to $ 701 million from $ 536 million last year .
the european segment , which includes gas and power operations there and other commodity sales like metals , coal and crude oil , remained flat at $ 53 million amid lower volatility .
the latest earnings report marked the first time that enron has provided a financial breakdown of the european and americas wholesale operations .
in doing so , lay delivered on a promise he made after skilling ' s departure : that he would make enron ' s financial reporting more transparent . many analysts and investors had grumbled about a lack of clarity from enron .

enron has third - quarter loss after expansion fails ( update 9 )
2001 - 10 - 16 16 : 29 ( new york )
enron has third - quarter loss after expansion fails ( update 9 )
( adds in sixth paragraph that losses are equal to 70 percent
of enron ' s profits over the last four quarters . closes shares . )
houston , oct . 16 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . , the largest
energy trader , had a $ 618 million loss in the third quarter after
expansion into water , telecommunications and retail - energy sales
cost the company $ 1 . 01 billion .
the loss was 84 cents a share after payment of preferred
dividends , enron said . net income a year earlier was $ 292 million ,
or 34 cents . revenue rose 59 percent to $ 47 . 6 billion .
investors have sent enron stock down 60 percent this year on
concern about investments outside energy trading and natural - gas
pipelines . some investors praised kenneth lay , enron ' s chairman
and chief executive officer , for acknowledging the failure of the
new businesses . others said they ' re not confident all the bad news
is out .
` ` what is disconcerting is that they didn ' t do this sooner , ' '
said donald coxe , manager of the $ 352 million harris insight
equity fund . ` ` if you kill one cockroach in the kitchen , it
doesn ' t mean there aren ' t more . ' '
investors have questioned enron ' s financial reporting in the
past year , especially after jeffrey skilling ' s resignation as ceo
in august . skilling , who helped lay transform enron from a gas -
pipeline company into the top competitor in energy trading , said
he left for personal reasons . investors said they weren ' t
confident enron was detailing all its problems .
failed businesses
the $ 1 . 01 billion in losses , which total $ 1 . 11 a share , are
equal to 70 percent of enron ' s $ 1 . 45 billion in profits over the
past four quarters .
included were $ 544 million for losses on investments in new
power co . , a venture formed with aol time warner inc . and
international business machines corp . new power competes for
energy sales in states that allow consumers to choose power and
gas suppliers as they do long - distance phone companies .
the $ 544 million also includes losses from the enron unit
that trades space , known as bandwidth , on fiber - optic networks , as
well as for the ` ` early termination of certain structured finance
arrangements ' ' with an undisclosed ` ` entity . ' ' enron wouldn ' t be
more specific .
enron said restructuring the fiber - optic unit would cost
another $ 180 million , including severance pay to 500 fired
workers . the business collapsed this year along with the fortunes
of the dot - com companies that were expected to be some off its
biggest customers .
the declining value of assets owned by azurix corp . , its
water and sewage treatment business , will cost $ 287 million , enron
said .
enron might take a first - quarter ` ` adjustment ' ' of less than
$ 200 million because of accounting changes related to goodwill ,
lay said in an interview . ` ` if we thought there were any other
significant concerns , we would have taken care of them today , ' '
lay said .
excluding losses
minus the losses , enron would have earned $ 393 million , or 43
cents a share , up 35 percent from the year - earlier period . that
matched the average estimate of analysts surveyed by thomson
financial / first call .
enron has averaged quarterly profit increases of 31 percent
for the past year . its wholesale services business , which includes
energy trading , had income before interest , minority interests and
taxes of $ 754 million , up 28 percent from a year earlier .
shares of enron rose 67 cents to $ 33 . 84 . earlier , the stock
had risen as much as 5 . 2 percent to $ 34 . 90 .
` ` there ' s a sigh of relief that enron ' s core businesses , its
energy merchant businesses , are ok , ' ' said roger hamilton , who
helps manage john hancock ' s value funds , which own 600 , 000 shares .
enron said it still expects to earn 45 cents a share in the
fourth quarter , $ 1 . 80 for the full year and $ 2 . 15 in 2002 .
` ridiculous investments '
at one time , enron pinned high hopes on the businesses that
contributed to the $ 1 . 01 billion in losses .
enron spent $ 2 . 8 billion in 1998 for the u . k . ' s wessex water ,
from which azurix emerged . enron sold shares to the public in
1999 , and then bought back the company this year after azurix
failed in its strategy of buying up water companies and winning
large projects . in august , enron agreed to sell azurix ' s north
american business to american water works inc . for $ 150 million .
in february 2000 , lay said trading bandwidth could become the
company ' s fastest - growing business . in the latest quarter , the
bandwidth unit ' s loss before interest , minority interests and
taxes widened to $ 80 million from $ 20 million a year earlier .
revenue plunged to $ 4 million from $ 162 million .
` ` you can make the case that jeff skilling leaving was for
the best , ' ' john hancock ' s hamilton said . ` ` under him , they built
the best trading operation while also making all these ridiculous
investments . ' '
while admitting its poor choices , enron also supplied more
information this quarter about how it makes money . the company
gave results of individual commodity - trading desks , including
coal , forest products and steel .
` ` i liked that they broke out the different commodities , ' '
hamilton said . ` ` i think lay has gotten the message loud and
clear , and that the effort is there . ' '",ham

subject : netco
the new year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into netco . obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized .
the main areas to focus on over the next week are : -
( i ) re - start / integration plans ( due on jan 7 ) to be forwarded to louise
these plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible .
the current restart date is january 21 , 2001 but may be pushed forward to january 14 , 2002 .
( ii ) budget ( due jan 3 , 2002 ) to be forwarded to faith killen
first year budget to include all start up costs ( some of which can be amortized )
( iii ) seating plans tammy shepperd to co - ordinate
we need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the enron south building .
i have asked tammy shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around january 11 , 2002 .
( iv ) due diligence
we continue the process with two new companies this week ( wednesday and thursday ) . andy zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on wednesday , please help him with his requirements .
i would ask that both john and i are notified of any changes to the netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis . please forward all alterations to jeanie slone who has responsibility for the master list .
communication - i believe that the new year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on netco and what our policies are . i am asking david oxley to co - ordinate with all of you on this . i know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible .
if you are unavailable this week , please ensure you delegate this work out .
happy new year

i talked to dawn fournier about space in three allen and they are working on trying to free up a floor . currently there is not a whole floor available . if they are successful then we will need to see what is currently set up on the floor and come up with the best plan for getting the space up and running asap . to do so we may need to provide network and telephony services instead of waiting on aep to build out their servers & install a phone switch .

"these are the events that took place concerning the new york customer holiday event :
in order to reserve rooms for the first weekend in ny at the four seasons , i have to book no later than 9 months out .
to hold these rooms , a contract had to be signed and a $ 15 , 000 deposit sent . the contract allowed us to cancel the entire event by the end of july with no penalty and the deposit was fully refundable .
in speaking with dave duran and frank vickers in may , they wanted to proceed with this event . ( attached is a memo that i sent to frank vickers outlining the cancellation policy . )
the cost estimate went through several revisions and the final was sent to you for your approval in july .
after the approval form was rejected , i spoke with dave duran and he was planning to revise his guest list and re - submit the approval form .
i talked to both frank and dave numerous times and reminded them of the hotel penalty issues and had not heard back from either one until i received an e - mail on september 20 th from frank canceling his portion of the trip .
i called my four seasons national sales rep and she is working with ny in canceling the contract and minimizing the hotel liquidated damages . i should have an answer from her no later than tomorrow .
please let me know if you would like to discuss this in more detail .
thanks .

"i set up the simulation model . the margin follows a mean - reverting process .
i seperarted the data into two category , margin > 0 . 04 and margin < 0 . 04 .
then i estimate the mean reverting speed seperately for these two data sets .
i got higher mean reverting speed than that i estimated using the whole data
set .
the high mr speed surpresses the probability at high payout side .
since the mr speed is sensitive to where i divide the data , so bob will run
a few senarios .
i put the overal settlement cap and floor into the montly premium
calculation , so the
the result in el 8 on the summary page is the ultimate answer to the deal
pricing .
i also calculate the undiscounted payout distribution and overall collar
worth .
relax the overall cap and floor will have a direct comparison with the spread

approach that bob and lee set up .
look like we got a reasonable model .

i ' d like to have you check my set up for the simulation model .

subject : enron management conference - home video project
the enron management conference will be held wednesday through friday , november 14 - 16 , 2001 , at the westin la cantera resort in san antonio . while the business agenda is still being finalized , there is one thing that is certain . . . we want to inject some humor into the event . the past year has been eventful , and at times challenging , for enron and its employees . however , it ' s not in enron ' s corporate fabric to focus on the past . instead , we want to look ahead , and even laugh at ourselves . the management conference will provide a platform for just that .
we want to challenge each of the business units to develop and submit a humorous "" home video "" to be presented at the management conference . the video can address any enron - related topic that your business unit chooses . however , there are a few rules to follow .
1 . ) the videos should be no more than five minutes long .
2 . ) business units should spend as little as possible on the videos , and no more than $ 10 , 000 . innovision communications ( beth stier ) has agreed to work with any business unit to help them create an original , inexpensive video . innovision can be contacted at 713 - 446 - 4424 .
3 . ) the videos should be fun , but not disparaging . they should adhere to enron ' s values of respect , integrity , communication and excellence .
4 . ) by monday , october 15 , business units need to notify me of their intention to submit a video . to avoid duplication , business units will also need to identify a topic they intend to address .
5 . ) to ensure inclusion in the management conference agenda , videos need to be submitted to me by friday , november 9 .
6 . ) awards will be given for creativity and humor . the first annual , and soon - to - be - coveted , "" enny "" will also be awarded for "" best overall video . ""
if you have any questions about the "" home video "" project , please contact myself or mary clark .

"i have been working with my national sales representative from the four seasons hotel to minimize our contract obligations from our cancellation of the new york customer holiday event dated november 30 - december 2 , 2001 .
the contract states that if enron should cancel the entire event within 90 days - 61 days prior to the scheduled commencement date of the event , enron would be liable for 50 % of the hotels liquidated damages , which is estimated at $ 28 , 218 .
after numerous conversations with the hotel , they have agreed to accept our initial deposit of $ 15 , 000 as full payment for the cancellation of this event . no additional costs will be charged to enron . i believe that this is a fair offer and hope that all parties involved find this acceptable .
in the meantime , i received a call from laura luce this morning and she is interested in continuing this event on a much reduced scale . the four seasons is willing to hold our initial reservation , with no additional penalties , until we can confirm if we would like to proceed .

i ' m also now told that the kern river expansion may be much larger than what we were led to believe a couple of weeks ago . we heard earlier that they were looking at doing a 500 mmcf / d expansion that would include the 124 mmcf / d expansion already sold . new information suggests that the 500 mmcf / d expansion may be significantly understated , and volumes may approach 700 - 800 mmcf / d . the expansion would include not only compression , but would involve additional pipe , and would not be rolled into existing rates , but would be an incrementally priced project .",ham

london - - bg group plc extended its reach in the indian subcontinent and expanded its exploration and production portfolio with the purchase of the offshore indian assets of u . s . energy group enron corp . for $ 388 million ( 422 million euros ) .
analysts applauded the purchase by the u . k . oil and gas company , saying it is acquiring some promising assets inexpensively . the price works out to less than $ 2 . 30 per barrel of oil equivalent , given the proven and probable reserves of more than 170 million barrels of oil equivalent of enron oil & gas india ltd . "" we value other indian oil and gas reserves at $ 2 . 90 ( assuming an oil price of $ 18 ) , so bg appears to have paid a good price , "" said abn amro in a research note .
a bombay - based energy analyst reckoned enron "" probably undersold , "" noting that earlier this year indian state - owned oil & natural gas corp . , a partner of enron ' s indian unit , had its $ 400 million offer for the assets rejected .
enron has experienced mixed success as an integrated energy operator in india , and is attempting to exit the controversial dabhol power project , india ' s largest private power plant , in which it has a 65 % controlling stake .
the indian unit ' s assets comprise a 30 % stake in the tapti gas field and the panna / mukta oil and gas field , and a 62 . 64 % interest in the cb - os / 1 exploration license in the gulf of cambay off western india . the enron unit is the designated operator of these developments .
equity production from the fields amounts to 20 , 000 barrels of oil equivalent a day , representing about 6 % to 7 % of bg ' s total output . for the year ended march 31 , enron ' s indian unit posted pro forma profit after tax of $ 60 million on revenue of $ 160 million .
the acquisition complements bg ' s fledgling refining and marketing interests in india , which include holdings in western indian distributors gujarat gas co . ( 65 % ) and mahanagar gas ( 50 % ) . it is also the driving force behind a project to pipe liquefied natural gas from iran to tap india ' s growing appetite for gas .

the deal is the latest sign of enron ' s retreat from the region , and comes as the group is separately attempting to withdraw from the $ 2 . 8 bn dabhol power plant following a payment dispute with maharashtra state .
bg is placing particular emphasis on developing markets .
it has operated in india for 10 years but has so far concentrated on gas distribution through a 65 per cent interest in gujarat gas company and a joint venture with the gas authority of india in mumbai .
david mcmanus , bg executive vice - president responsible for eastern hemisphere business , said the transaction would give it the opportunity to develop the indian gas market . the company has a view to creating demand for imported liquefied natural gas through bg ' s planned pipavav lng terminal in gujarat .
"" india has the second fastest - growing gas market after china and we see it as a core place to use our expertise , "" he said .
the agreement is subject to confirmation from enron ' s partners that bg will be able to take over operating the fields , and consent from the indian government .
analysts said the acquisition was a logical next step for bg and appeared good value against market expectations of a $ 600 m price for the assets .
iain reid of ubs warburg said : "" either bg are extremely good negotiators or there is an element of risk attached to the speed at which production can be increased . ""

british natural gas company bg group has struck a deal to buy enron corp . ' s offshore oil and natural gas properties in india for $ 388 million in cash , the companies said wednesday .
these properties are the last of the oil - and gas - producing properties houston - based enron retained after it spun off enron oil & gas , now named eog resources .
the deal marks another step for houston - based enron away from owning large physical assets . the company wants to focus on trading and making markets in a variety of commodities .
it is "" another significant step for enron in selling assets not integrated into its wholesale or retail energy businesses , "" the company said in a written statement .
enron ' s other assets for sale in india include the controversial dabhol power project , india ' s largest private power plant , in which enron holds a 65 percent controlling stake .
reports surfaced wednesday that enron might be willing to sell its stake in the $ 3 billion project at a discount . analysts have said for months now that enron would like to exit the project but has been unable to find a buyer willing to make the right offer . tata power co . , india ' s largest private electricity firm , has acknowledged that it has held preliminary talks over dabhol .
the oil and natural gas reserves sale includes a 30 percent stake in the tapti natural gas field and the panna / mukta oil and natural gas field 60 miles northwest of mumbai and a 62 . 6 percent interest in the offshore block cb - os / 1 exploration license . all are on the west coast of india .
production from the fields is about 70 million cubic feet of gas and 8 , 200 barrels of oil per day . reserves in the field are estimated to be 170 million barrels of oil equivalent . bg paid about $ 2 . 30 per barrel of oil equivalent .
the other partners in the tapti and panna / mukta offshore operations are oil and natural gas corp . , which holds 40 percent , and reliance industries , with a 30 percent stake . the other partners in the cb - os / 1 license are hindustan oil exploration co . , with 17 . 36 percent , tata petrodyne with 10 percent , and oil and natural gas corp . with 10 percent .
enron acquired its natural gas reserves in india with an eye to using them as fuel in the dabhol plant .
in august , houston - based enron said it and its other foreign partners were ready to sell their stakes in dabhol for no less than $ 1 billion , an amount estimated to be sufficient only to cover their costs and direct financial investment in the project .
dabhol has been facing problems for nearly a year over high tariffs and payment defaults by the maharashtra state electricity board , its sole customer . it was forced to shut down its 740 megawatt plant on india ' s west coast in june after the board stopped buying power .
john ambler , enron spokesman , would not comment specifically on any possible negotiations to sell the dabhol project , but said the company favors selling its stake .
"" we continue to believe that the quickest and best approach for solving this issue is for the government of india and / or indian financial institutions to acquire the foreign stakeholders in the plant , "" ambler said . "" we are continuing to pursue the legal remedies available to us under the power purchase agreement and are seeking a recovery of our costs . ""
the shutdown has stalled an expansion program that was almost complete and would have raised the generating capacity at the project to 2 , 184 megawatts .
other partners in dabhol include general electric and the bechtel construction firm , which each own 10 percent .
the remaining 15 percent is held by the maharashtra state electricity board , the nearly bankrupt power distribution monopoly in the state where the plant is located .
bg ' s existing interests in india include holdings in western indian natural gas distributors gujarat gas co . and mahanagar gas . the company is also working on a project to move liquefied natural gas from iran via pipeline into india .
india ' s gas demand is projected to grow by 50 percent over the next 10 years , while its gas production is declining .
edison rates to remain high under utility ' s deal with state
by karen gaudette
associated press writer

associated press newswires
copyright 2001 . the associated press . all rights reserved .
san francisco ( ap ) - consumer advocates warn that southern california edison customers , already saddled with last spring ' s record rate increase until 2003 , could face even more rate hikes in the months ahead .
the deal secretly negotiated with the state public utilities commission this week settles a lawsuit filed by edison last november and is designed to keep the utility from following pacific gas and electric , the state ' s largest utility , into bankruptcy .
it lets edison pay off more than $ 3 billion of a $ 3 . 9 billion debt , in part by forcing ratepayers to continue paying higher rates imposed last may for at least the next two years .
consumer advocates , however , said wednesday that other consequences of the state ' s power crisis could send rates higher still .
the state ' s power - buying agency has yet to announce exactly how much money it needs from utility customers to repay the state for the billions of dollars it has spent buying electricity this year and to pay for about $ 43 billion of long - term power already contracted for delivery .
the prospect of continuing to pay higher rates and possibly enduring even more price hikes in the future dismayed some edison customers .
"" we can ' t stay in business , "" said william ho , general manager of top hat cleaners in west hollywood , where the monthly electric bill has gone from $ 600 before the state ' s energy crisis to nearly $ 1 , 200 . "" we would have to raise prices , and we ' re already heading into a recession . ""
ho said top hat has tried to cut back on electricity use by shutting off display lights in the windows . but he added , "" you can ' t press clothes in the dark . ""
it ' s unclear how much more money ratepayers will be called upon to contribute without knowing how much the state needs to pay billions of dollars in power - buying costs , said nettie hoge , executive director of the utility reform network , a san francisco - based consumer advocacy group .
hoge and other consumer advocates said this week ' s deal amounts to a ratepayer bailout of edison , which supported the state ' s failed deregulation plan .
"" it ' s like saying i ' m not going to beat you any harder , so it shouldn ' t hurt , "" she said .
john bryson , edison international president and chief executive officer , said the settlement would help the utility restore its good credit and repay its creditors .
edison owes nearly $ 4 billion to hundreds of power companies , ranging from energy marketing giant enron corp . to the state independent system operator , manager of the state ' s power grid .
"" the agreement means stability , predictability , "" he said during a conference call with reporters wednesday . "" it means preserving and enhancing the infrastructure of electricity that makes the economy of our region work . ""
the puc said the agreement would help the state begin pulling away from its role as a power - buyer . commission president loretta lynch said the agency had little choice in figuring a way to let edison repay its debts and avoid bankruptcy .
"" i think that this is a balanced compromise , but clearly it does allow ratepayers to pay off some of the back debt , "" she said .
the state department of water resources so far has spent $ 9 billion buying electricity for customers of edison , pacific gas and electric co . and san diego gas and electric co .
the shareholder - owned utilities suffered huge losses by being unable to pass along soaring wholesale power costs to their ratepayers . the state ' s 1996 deregulation law imposed a price cap on energy rates paid by customers .
that price cap was the focal point of edison ' s lawsuit against the puc , with the utility contending the state had no right to prevent the utility from passing the cost of energy to its customers .
under the deal struck this week , edison also must direct its available cash and an estimated $ 1 . 2 billion it would have issued in shareholder dividends toward paying its debt . the utility could be due refunds ordered by federal energy regulators , and that money also would have to help pay down the debt .
the agreement now goes before u . s . district court judge ronald s . w . lew in los angeles , who could rule on it this week .
"" right now judge lew has his hands in the pockets of ratepayers . . . . will he pull out $ 3 . 3 billion for edison or will he protect the working men and women of california who can least afford to pay a superfluous bailout tax ? "" said douglas heller of the santa monica - based foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights , which organized a protest rally wednesday outside the federal courthouse in los angeles .
heller estimated the settlement could cost edison ratepayers $ 750 each over the next four years .

bg is to buy enron ' s oil and gas assets off india ' s west coast for $ 388 m ( pounds 263 m ) in a move that will make the uk - based oil and gas producer the largest foreign investor in the country ' s upstream energy market .
the deal will add 5 per cent to bg ' s total output , with 19 , 000 barrels of oil equivalent a day , of which 60 per cent is gas . according to david mcmanus , bg ' s executive vice president , it will be earnings accretive from day one . "" there is currently a deficit between the supply of gas , which is currently all indigenous gas , and the need for gas within india , "" mr mcmanus said .
some analysts see demand doubling over the next 10 years , making india one of the world ' s fastest - growing energy markets .
the assets being sold by the us group enron include a 30 per cent stake in the tapti field and the panna mukta field north - west of bombay .
bg shares closed down 2 . 5 p at 261 p in a mixed oil sector after the news . mark redway , an analyst at teather & greenwood , said : "" the logic is good and they ' re paying quite a low multiple at six or seven times last year ' s earnings , but [ after the 11 september attacks in the us ] there ' s a lot of investor nervousness at the moment over exposure to this part of the world .

new delhi , oct . 3 . bg india has entered into a conditional agreement to acquire enron ' s offshore interests in the country for a consideration of $ 388 million .
the contract signed on tuesday night with enron oil and gas india ltd involves purchase of the latter ' s 30 per cent stake in the tapti gas field and the panna - mukta gas / oil fields besides the 62 . 64 per cent interest in the cb - os / 1 exploration block .
addressing a press conference here on wednesday , mr nigel shaw , bg india chief executive officer , said that the sale was contingent on the other stakeholders agreeing to bg as the operator of the exploration fields .
the rider of approval from other stakeholders comes in the backdrop of oil and natural gas corporation ( ongc ) , a 40 per cent stakeholder in the panna - mukta , tapti fields , besides a 10 per cent stake in the cb - os / 1 exploration block , seeking operatorship of the fields .
when contacted , the ongc chairman , mr subir raha , said , "" ongc ' s position remains unchanged and it is still pressing for operatorship of the fields . we are currently in talks with bg on the issue . ""
"" we are in talks with the government as well as ongc on the issue . we are not contemplating a situation when operatorship is denied , ""
mr shaw replied when queried on the issue . he stressed that in case the other parties do not agree , the deal will fall through . "" we will walk away in such an event , "" he said .
on the legality of ongc ' s claim , mr shaw said , "" under the agreement , at the point of change of control ( from enron to bg ) , the other stakeholders can object to the transfer of operatorship ( to bg ) . however , the contract is not clear on the deadlock . ""
mr shaw was hopeful that the transfer of shares would take place by the end of the month .
currently , in the tapti and panna - mukta gas fields , reliance industries ltd holds 30 per cent stake while ongc holds 40 per cent equity . in the case of the cb - os / 1 exploration field , hindustan oil and exploration company holds 17 . 36 per cent , tata petrodyne 10 per cent and ongc 10 per cent .
the bg vision : bg plans to double the gas production capacity of the tapti gas fields by 2004 , according to mr shaw . though not willing to reveal the quantum of investment in the future , he said that bg would be committed to its share in the expansion of the fields besides the exploration efforts on cb - os / 1 field where three wells are scheduled to be drilled in december .
"" there is opportunity for significant investment in the fields and one of the frustrations has been the lack of this . ""
bg will be honouring the present gas sale agreement with gas authority of india ltd ( gail ) which involves sale of gas at base load level for the life of the asset ( exploration field ) . however , the venture will be free to find new markets for sale of any incremental gas recovered from the fields . currently , the fields yield 70 million standard cu . feet of gas per day and 8 , 200 barrels of oil per day .
bg has a 50 per cent stake in mahanagar gas ltd , a gas supply company in mumbai . further , it is in the process of setting up an lng regassification terminal in pipavav .
bg is not interested in buying out enron ' s upcoming lng regassification facility at dabhol since it is setting up its own lng regassification terminal at pipavav , gujarat , mr shaw said .
mr shaw said that given the vast market potential and the dwindling recovery from the domestic fields , there would not be any conflict of interest between the gas sold from the lng terminal and that from the exploration fields .
on the pricing front , the tapti and panna - mukta fields enjoy a fixed price contract till 2004 . beyond this period , the pricing is internationally linked .
once the deal is completed , bg india plans to initiate talks with reliance industries ltd ( ril ) and ongc to second their personnel at the operating level of the exploration venture , according to mr shaw .
further , it would minimise the involvement of its parent company in london as well as keep the number of expatriates in the joint ventures to a minimum .
bg has so far invested $ 150 million in its ventures in the country .

british gas to buy enron ' s oil , gas assets for $ 388 m

british gas india today announced that it has reached an agreement to buy the assets of enron oil & gas india ltd for $ 388 million . the assets include a 30 per cent interest in the tapti gas field and the panna / mukta oil and gas fields as well as a 62 . 64 per cent interest in a licence to explore the cb - os / 1 block . all three are located on the west coast of india and are operated by enron .
however , british gas india chief executive officer nigel shaw said the deal is subject to the condition that british gas gets operational control of the fields . "" if we are not the operator , we will walk away from the deal , "" he said . the deal , signed in london last night , would require clearance from the indian government . shaw revealed that british gas india has already initiated a dialogue with the government for this .
but the deal seems to have run into a roadblock even before the ink on it has dried . the state - owned oil & natural gas corporation ( ongc ) which has a 40 per cent interest in the fields is expected to try for the operatorship of the oil and gas fields which were earlier operated by enron oil & gas .
however , petroleum minister ram naik said "" all issues will be sorted out in due course "" . "" enron today wrote to me to go ahead with the deal . we will examine the issue , "" he said .
according to oil industry sources , the operatorship is based on a consensus _ and not on the percentage of shares held _ among shareholders . the proposed sale of enron ' s assets does not "" mean an automatic transfer of operatorship and the shareholders will have to come to a consensus , "" ongc sources claim .
what is more , ongc had earlier unsuccessfully bid $ 350 million for enron ' s oil and gas assets . ongc has the first right of refusal , according to an ongc official . ongc chairman s raha was unavailable for comment .
shaw admitted that the contract between the three existing partners does not lay down the course of action in case a deadlock emerges on the issue of operating the oil and gas fields .
"" we are in active discussion with both ongc and reliance . we are hopeful of wrapping it up by the end of this month , "" shaw said .
an ongc official , however , said the state - owned company was aware of the development but had not been informed officially by enron .
shaw also disclosed that british gas was willing to make further investments to ramp up production at the tapti and the panna / mukta fields .
"" further investments have not happened as the partners could not agree . we are looking at the possibility of doubling production by 2004 , "" he said .
when asked what would be the investment required for such an exercise , shaw said that it would run into hundreds of millions of dollars .
the three oil and gas fields together produce around 300 million cubic meters of gas and 29 , 000 barrels of oil a day .
an enron spokesman refused to comment on the issue of operatorship as did a reliance spokesman .
enron oil & gas has 30 per cent interest in the tapti gas and panna / mukta oil and gas field , ongc has a 40 per cent interest and reliance has the remaining 30 per cent .
in the case of cb - os / 1 , the other partners are hindustan oil exploration company with 17 . 36 per cent and tata petrodyne and ongc with 10 per cent each .

subject : tenaska iv 10 / 00
we have actuals . the larger of the two volumes is 1 , 395 , 000 , which is
45 , 000 / day , so the demand rate in deal 514353 is fine . i am having a
problem , though , with the way it is coming to settlements . it is showing up
with a jan 2003 delivery date . i think the demand fee needs to be on 10 / 1
only . right now , it is on a line with a date of 10 / 1 / 00 to 12 / 31 / 36 . i
think this is confusing the system some how . also , we still need the
purchase deal for tenaska iv . it should be for a demand fee of $ 2 , 571 , 135 . 73
booked to the cleburne desk . we actually owe $ 1 , 798 , 389 . 73 , but i need to
net the tenaska iv sales with the purchase to clear those receivables . james
is calling me every day asking for an update . do you know when we will be
able to get this in the system ? i have attached my spreadsheet so you can
see the numbers .

"howard - the above meter indicates a daily swing with no one in volume
management ' s initials in oss . i need some information for daren before it
can be determined if a deal should be set up to cover the 089 contract for
11 / 97 forward .
i ' ve done some research as follows :
1 / 95 shows delivery on transport contract # 012 - 82269 - 02 - 002 ( southeastern
marketing co . as counterparty )
1 / 96 thru 10 / 31 / 97 shows delivery on transport contract # 012 - 27182 - 02 - 001
( esperanza marketing corp as counterparty ) .
11 / 97 thru 12 / 97 shows delivery on 089 - 41500 - 102
1 / 98 shows delivery on 089 - 41500 - 101
no other transactions at this meter since 1 / 98 .
some questions i need answered are - why was volume allocated to transport
contracts through 10 / 31 / 97 and then started to be allocated to the 089
contract later ? are the transport contracts no longer valid to allocate to
and is that the reason the 089 contract was used ? or should the transport
contract be allocated to instead of the 089 contract for 11 / 97 forward ? each
item indicates a delivered volume , so either a transport or sale is taking
place .
all the information that is supplied on the ua 4 report is need a contract for
9 , 448 mmbtu .
since the meter was assigned to someone else during this timeframe before it
was assigned to me , it ' s difficult to know why the 089 contract was ever used
for allocation and since there are no other records such as deal tickets in
cpr or oss .

"the senate rules committee just met . during the hearing , senate leader john burton stated that :
the senate intends to rewrite the version of the mou that the assembly approved last thursday night and sent over to the senate for final approval ( sb 78 ) .
the version of the mou that will emerge from the senate sometime this week will look much more like the bill that originally passed out of the senate prior to the july summer recess . that bill was unacceptable to edison and davis , which led to the version that the assembly developed and approved last thursday night .
if the senate proceeds as burton suggests , the chances are very low that an mou will make it through the legislature and get davis ' signature .
burton generally sticks to his word . but there is still time for additional negotiations and sb 78 could squeak by . however , burton ' s comments in the rules committee certainly don ' t help 78 ' s chances for survival .
finally , the assembly is currently debating the last surviving windfall profits bill , and the bill is having a hard time getting the votes necessary for passage . more information on the windfall profits bill as we get it .

his decision as final but we still appreciate the interest he showed
in enron .
we never had any luck hiring a statistician .
maybe we shall get one some day .

subject : statistician from rice
i had a message on my phone this morning from william indicating that
he had changed his mind and will be taking another job . he also mentions that
the other organization will give him time to publish his thesis and he
assumes
enron would not do that .
i am inclined to give up on him but wanted to get your input before doing so .

reuters english news service
( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
new york , nov 5 ( reuters ) - fitch on monday cut its ratings on the debt of embattled energy trader enron corp . and warned that it may cut the ratings again if the company does not reduce its debts , if its trading business deteriorates or if charges exceed present estimates .
"" today ' s rating action reflects the difficulties enron faces in managing its liquidity position in the face of an erosion in investor confidence , "" fitch said .
fitch cut houston - based enron ' s senior unsecured debt to "" bbb - minus , "" one notch above junk , from "" bbb - plus , "" its subordinated debt to "" bb "" from "" bbb , "" and its commercial paper to "" f 3 "" from "" f 2 . "" the rating agency also downgraded enron ' s preferred stock to "" b - plus "" from "" bbb - minus . ""
fitch said reducing debt and exiting problem businesses are a management priority , and if enron is successful , the company ' s credit profile will improve . "" however , the targeted transactions have varying degrees of execution risk , particularly the divestiture of assets in emerging - market countries , "" fitch said .
fitch ' s cut follows downgrades last week by moody ' s investors service and standard & poor ' s . enron ' s shares have lost more than 65 percent in less than a month amid concerns about financial practices that triggered an investigation by the u . s . securities and exchange commission .
s & p last thursday cut enron ' s corporate credit and senior unsecured debt ratings to "" bbb , "" two notches above junk status , from "" bbb - plus . "" moody ' s investors service last monday cut enron ' s senior unsecured debt to "" baa 2 , "" two notches above junk , from "" baal . ""
downgrades could make it tougher for enron to issue debt and run its day - to - day business if fellow marketers and traders demand more collateral .
enron lined up $ 1 billion of new credit last week but may still have to sell assets to head off a credit squeeze and restore investor confidence , according to investment bankers .
in its third - quarter results report last month , enron said it expected over a billion dollars of write - offs related to soured investments . it also announced an extra $ 1 . 2 billion write - down of shareholder equity related to investments that were not recorded on its balance sheet .
enron ' s 6 . 4 percent notes due in 2006 , bid at about 80 cents on the dollar a week ago , were bid at 73 cents on the dollar on monday , a strategist said .
enron shares were up 40 cents , or 3 . 55 percent , at $ 11 . 67 in midday trade on the new york stock exchange . the shares have been in free - fall for two weeks .

business wire
( copyright ( c ) 2001 , business wire )
new york - - ( business wire ) - - nov . 5 , 2001 - - fitch downgrades enron ' s outstanding securities as follows : senior unsecured debt to ` bbb - ' from ` bbb + ' ; subordinated debt to ` bb ` from ` bbb ' ; and preferred stock to ` b + ' from ` bbb - ` . enron ' s commercial paper has been downgraded to ` f 3 ' from ` f 2 ' . the senior unsecured debt ratings of its pipeline subsidiaries , northern natural gas co . and transwestern pipeline co . , are lowered to ` bbb - ' from ` a - ` . all the above securities remain on rating watch negative status . fitch would consider further downgrades if enron were unable to make progress in reducing debt , if its wholesale marketing and trading business were to show signs of material deterioration , or if expenses and charges related to the disposition of non - core businesses and investments exceed present estimations .
today ' s rating action reflects the difficulties enron faces in managing its liquidity position in the face of an erosion in investor confidence . this follows the recognition of a substantial diminution in value of its global merchant investments , which were partly financed with an aggressive use of off - balance sheet vehicles . enron should be able to manage through this challenging environment , ultimately recognizing the values of the company ' s core businesses .
in october , enron fully drew down the bulk of its committed bank facilities and paid down outstanding commercial paper , leaving it approximately $ 1 billion of cash on hand to support normal business activities . in addition , the company is in the process of executing a new $ 1 billion secured bank facility that pledges the assets of northern natural and transwestern . unsecured creditors are structurally subordinated to the secured lenders reducing asset coverage . while its current cash position appears adequate , securing additional capital sources through asset sales or raising additional capital would be a favorable development .
a management priority is debt reduction and the exiting of problem businesses . clearly , these actions , if completed as envisioned will reduce risk and improve the company ' s credit profile . however , the targeted transactions have varying degrees of execution risk , particularly the divestiture of assets in emerging market countries . an additional uncertainty is the securities and exchange commission ' s ( sec ) investigation of certain enron sponsored partnerships . the outcome and potential impact of the sec activity is difficult to predict .
the largest announced transaction is the sale of portland general electric co . ( pge ) to northwest natural gas co . the sale appears to be moving ahead as planned and has the favorable support of key local interests . however , the transaction is not expected to close for another year .
enron ' s core businesses have continued to generate strong , predictable performance and have significant value . prospectively , operations at enron ' s domestic regulated pipelines would be less affected by any lingering uncertainty at enron . also , pge is expected to generate positive and predictable earnings and cash flow over the next year . combined , the pipelines and pge generate nearly 25 % of ebitda . wholesale and retail energy services segments have also consistently reported predictable and growing returns . specifically , commodity marketing and trading activities , which comprise the most profitable and largest part of wholesale operations , have generated steady volume growth and stable unit margins . however , if enron were unable to maintain the support of its counterparties or exhibited diminished financial flexibility , these businesses would be harmed .

new york , nov 5 ( reuters ) - stocks are seen climbing at the open of trading on monday , as wall street looks for another half - point interest - rate cut on tuesday to help put the lagging economy back on track and boost slumping corporate profits .
equities are getting an additional boost from the treasury ' s decision last week to stop selling 30 - year bonds , sending cash flowing out of bonds and into stocks , traders said .
the gain in futures is "" the half - point talking , "" said brian finnerty , co - head of capital markets at c . e . unterberg towbin . "" the cut continues the aggressive moves on the part of the fed , and it comes on top of a huge move by the treasury . the treasury did more in one fell swoop last week than the fed ' s done all year . ""
technology stocks rose in early trading , as investors geared up for cisco systems inc . ' s quarterly results after exchanges close . analysts said the networking gear maker is likely to signal lagging sales are near a turnaround .
december futures for the standard & poor ' s 500 index climbed 8 points , or 0 . 7 percent , to 1 , 097 . 50 , while december futures for the nasdaq composite index rose 21 points , or 1 . 5 percent , to 1 , 454 . 50 . the indicative dow jones index , which represents a basket of dow stocks trading in europe , slipped 2 . 4 points , or 0 . 02 percent .
the u . s . federal reserve is widely expected to cut interest rates for a 10 th time this year at its meeting on tuesday , to help jump - start the lagging economy . lower interest rates cut borrowing costs and can spur business development .
blue chips rallied on friday , helping the broader market eke out gains , as investors shrugged off a report of the biggest u . s . job losses in more than two decades in october to bet on an economic recovery next year .
"" any kind of bad news hasn ' t been able to hold the market down , "" said bob basel , a listed trader with salomon smith barney .
cisco rose to $ 17 . 80 on electronic trading system instinet , up from its close of $ 17 . 26 . the company , which makes networking gear that helps power the internet , is expected to report fiscal first - quarter results after exchanges close . cisco is likely to signal sales are near a rebound , indicating the lagging tech industry has reached its low point and will begin to rebound soon , analysts and investors said .
microsoft corp . rose to $ 61 . 74 from its friday close of $ 61 . 40 . microsoft and the justice department reached a settlement agreement last week . still , state antitrust enforcers have found what they say are serious flaws in the settlement , and the two sides may not be able to sign the deal in its current form , the wall street journal reported in its online edition on monday . the european union said on monday its probe of microsoft continues despite the settlement .
enron corp . , the struggling energy giant , rose to $ 11 . 80 on instinet , up from its close of $ 11 . 27 on friday . royal dutch / shell group may mount an $ 11 billion bid for enron , the uk ' s independent paper reported on sunday .
enron lined up $ 1 billion of new credit last week , but it still suffered a second credit rating cut amid concerns about questionable financial transactions that have triggered an investigation by the u . s . securities and exchange commission .
pixar animation studios inc . jumped to $ 37 . 25 from a friday close of $ 36 . 70 . pixar and walt disney co . scored a monstrous opening with their latest family cartoon "" monsters , inc . , "" scaring up $ 63 . 5 million in ticket sales in its first three days , according to studio estimates issued on sunday .
baxter international inc . fell to $ 47 . 60 on instinet from its close of $ 49 after it said preliminary tests show a processing fluid used in its manufacturing operations in sweden may have played a role in kidney patient deaths linked to dialysis machines .
baxter said it plans to permanently discontinue making the product and warned it will take a fourth - quarter charge to cover costs related to the product cancellation .
european markets gained on monday , led by technology and auto stocks . solid wall street futures and the prospect of more interest rate cuts later this week buoyed sentiment , traders said . wall street ' s resiliency on friday , when investors looked beyond poor payrolls numbers and bet on a recovery next year , also helped steady european nerves .
the ftse eurotop 300 index was up 1 . 5 percent and the euro stoxx 50 index rose 1 . 8 percent . technology and auto stocks were the strongest as players funneled cash back into sectors which fell hard after the sept . 11 attacks in the united states .
tokyo stocks inched higher in extremely thin trade on monday after gains in sony corp and other select blue - chip stocks buoyed a market still wary of dwindling earnings and a bleak outlook for the u . s . economy .
the benchmark nikkei average climbed 0 . 61 percent or 63 . 76 points to 10 , 447 . 54 , landing in positive turf for the second straight session .

uk : british power trading slow , prompt lifted early .

reuters english news service
( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
london , nov 5 ( reuters ) - british electricity trading was slow on monday , with traders saying prompt prices were ending broadly unchanged after a higher start in part because of a band of colder weather affecting much of the country .
"" it ' s a fairly quiet market , still lacking liquidity , "" said one trader , referring to the reluctance of some companies to deal with enron .
in the u . s . the securities and exchange commision is investigating substantial losses at enron relating to a private equity operation run by the group ' s former chief financial officer .
traders said the prompt market opened strong with day - ahead baseload lifted at 20 pounds a megawatt hour .
but the early strength evaporated during the day and in late trade the contract was down to about 17 pounds .
december baseload gained early support from day - ahead . it was finishing the day at about 18 . 40 pounds from a low of 18 . 34 pounds .
ql 01 baseload was seen as high as 19 . 45 pounds before it fell to 19 . 30 / 19 . 35 pounds in the afternoon .
summer 02 baseload was a touch stronger at 17 . 25 pounds while winter 02 was assessed at 19 . 25 pounds .

i ran out of memory and had to have it people coming to clean it for me .
their suggestion is
to either get a new hard drive or a new pc . given that dell has pentiumc iii
processor at 800 mhz
on market , i would like to request a pc with process at 500 mhz or higher
level .
thank you very much .

i would like to organize a vitro project review meeting during the next several weeks focusing on the technical risk in the deal and the mitigation measures we taking . the objective of the meeting is to ensure all related enron entities are supportive of the transaction and have had the opportunity to ask questions . this will reduce the chance that we will run into objections down the road on "" technical risks "" as we begin to ramp up our capital commitments . we had a similar meeting with the electrobolt team in enron s . america , that was very productive and accomplished the above objectives .
do you have a project presentation that you ( and / or the lead developer ) could discuss with the above team ? we could do it by phone - or better yet - the next time you are in houston . as many of the technical risk issues are also tied to commercial aspects of the deal we should also cover these areas as well ( e . g . , commercial objectives and obligations driving the technical design and implementation strategy ) .
i don ' t mean to be sticking my nose into your deal , other than to ensure that everyone is moving in the same direction so that we can get this implemented successfully .
let me know as to your availability ,

subject : re : benchmarking study
i passed this information along to some of my direct reports for their
thoughts , and truthfully didn ' t hear back from anyone and didn ' t follow up .
two years ago , we agreed to be part of a benchmarking study that was done by
aa ' s houston office ( interestingly enough , wes colwell was the aa partner who
led this effort ) and we had mixed results . the study was designed to cover
gas and power . despite our involvement in the steering committee , the study
itself was very , very detailed , such that it was troublesome to complete .
jim fallon at the time refused to submit information on the majority of the
questions surrounding power , so our survey data for power was not very
useful .
i would agree that at this time we will pass on this request . thanks for
passing it along , however . i would be happy to convey this directly to the
person that has contacted you . just let me know his / her name and number and
i will follow through on that if you would like .
hope that your holidays was enjoyable and that the new year will be a good
one for you . - - sally

sally ,
i gave you some time ago a brochure on this benchmarking study request .
they renewed their request for enron ' s participation .
what is your view on this ? do you think the benefits of knowing what ' s
going on offset the loss due information released and time spent on the
project .
my recommendation is to forget it .

"an old scam has surfaced recently with renewed vigor . the nigerian - 419 fraud letter , so called because it violates section 419 of nigerian law , is sent in many variations , by surface and airmail as well as by fax and email . generally the form it takes is to ask the unsuspecting victim to provide their bank account information in return for a promise to deposit a very large sum of money into that account under some pretext .

will you make sure the estimates that are in pops are corrected to reflect

hang seng bank ltd
sai wan ho branch
171 shaukiwan road
hong kong .
sir ,
let me start by introducing myself . i am mr feng lee . director of operations of the hang seng bank ltd , sai wan ho branch . i have a mutual beneficial business suggestion for you .
before the u . s and iraqi war , our client major fadi basem who was with the iraqi forces and also a business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months , with a value of fifty five million , five hundred thousand united state dollars ( us $ 55 . 5 m ) only in my branch . upon maturity several notice was sent to him , even during the war two years ago ( 2003 ) . again after the war another
notification was sent and still no response came from him . we later found out that the major and his family had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home .
after further investigation it was also discovered that major fadi basem did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit . and he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank . so , fifty five million , five hundred thousand united state dollars ( us $ 55 . 5 m ) is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it . what bothers me most is that according to the laws of my country at the expiration four years six months the funds will revert to the ownership of the hong kong government if nobody applies to claim the funds .
against this backdrop , my suggestion to you is that i will like you as a foreigner to front for me and stand as the next of kin to major fadi basem so that you will be able to receive his funds .
please , if you are capable of standing as the next of kin to major fadi basem , you should indicate so that i will give you more information . absolute confidentiality is required from you . besides , i will use my connection to get some documents to back up the fund so that the fund can not be question by any authourity .
i will give you further details of the transaction when i recieve a positive response from you and also the ration which the money will be shared between both of us .
treat as very urgent .
yours faithfully ,
mr . feng lee .

"tom , we attached both a consolidated p & l and an updated prudency schedule .
the weater hedge made $ 165 , 000 today . the only odd thing that we saw was the
physical change due to deal changes with the hplc operational desk . this desk
is a desk that is set up to account for fuel , gas loss , and physical ua 4 , we
have tickets out there with zero volumes on them that get updated after the
month is over once volume management knows where the gas needs to be
allocated . what we found out that happened was that in the last week of
february and in the first week of march sitara added volumes to these tickets
before were were running comparison reports to see the changes . darren
noticed the incorrect volumes on these tickets and had logistics zero them
out . darren thought that the changes would have no position effect as if it
were a deal between hplc and texas , but it is actuall as if we changed a deal
that we did with another region . the value was offset by changes in tufco
and storage . we released $ 270 , 000 out of march prudency to keep you flat for
the day . hope you had fun at the school function . i ' ll be here until about
8 : 30 , so feel free to call if you get this .

hello !
congratulations on your new arrival - hope you are all well . got married on 26 may and got sunshine in dublin on the day !
we are running the virtual entry capacity as an auction
bids due in on 9 july ( may be extended if transco delay their auction )
5 year minimum term
any terminal
we have right to refuse gas at the beach on payment of compensation chosen by customer in the bid .
we are still running analysis to produce beach curves based but current thinking is that
current market inefficiency is inflating the price ( we are currently buying day ahead interruptible fergus capacity at 0 . 3 p and buying gas as it turns firm on the day at nbp - 7 p )
our aim is to take out the conservative guys in our auction so the transco auctions should be less ridiculous ( summer max price was 12 p but the average was 6 p , with wide spreads in each auction round
we have modelled with transcost to verify transco ' s view that fergus can be expanded by 50 % for 1 p / th lrmc
also we have some other risk management angles we intend to pursue if we end up with a large position
offer underwriting on incremental investment by transco
code modifications to increase capacity auctioned
build a pipeline !
it would be great to get your views on it - shall i give you a call when we ' ve pulled together the curve analysis ?

hey there ! congrats with scott william . i hope all is going well . fifteen days and counting till our third arrival . i ' ve attached the dash that documented the divestiture . the quick summary of the economics per heather kroll are as follows :
original basis of $ 8 mm .
signed the purchase and sale agreement on may 16 for $ 22 mm ( gain of $ 14 mm )
sold put for $ 3 . 5 mm with $ 1 . 7 mm granted to origination . i don ' t know for sure what the desk booked .
the coal supply contract resulted in $ 5 mm mark to market to egm .
the ferc 203 filing has been made regarding market power . they are not expecting any issues with ferc or the north carolina commission and expect final approval by the beginning of july .
net gain of about $ 21 mm on transaction .
chris lee , the managing partner of highstar , has requested the opportunity to take you and i out to dinner sometime after you ' ve returned and settled back in to discuss the merits of enron ' s investment in highstar . if that ' s of interest let me know and i can schedule some time .

"cera alert : december 13 , 2000
title : california on the brink
cera knowledge areas : western energy , n . american power , n . american gas
california on the brink
the california stalemate
california moved closer to the brink of an outage today as concerns over
credit - worthiness of buyers brought the possibility that generators would
avoid selling to the california market . while numerous factors have
contributed to the high cost of power incurred by california ' s utilities , the
root cause of the current crisis is a lack of new generation . the current
credit crisis and its threat to supplies could spark state action to address
the situation . the collective efforts of all market participants should be
focused on increasing generation capacity as quickly as possible .
western power prices have skyrocketed well beyond the record levels set this
summer . perhaps because frozen rates insulate the majority of california
consumers and companies from tangible effects of the market crisis ,
regulators have been able to postpone meaningful market reforms and
significant rate increases . the california public utilities commission denied
the requests of pacific gas & electric and southern california edison to end
their rate freezes , forcing these utilities at least temporarily to finance
the costs of higher wholesale energy . this has created an unsustainable
accumulation of costs and a loss of faith in the california market .
the current credit crisis and the potential for blackouts may become the
galvanizing events that provide state regulators with a public mandate to
address the underlying structural problems in the industry . however , there is
no guarantee that these regulatory actions will expedite an effective
solution for customers and the industry as a whole . wholesale and retail
markets that emerge from regulatory intervention are likely to remain
muddled . in the necessarily political process that will follow , it is
possible that - as has largely been the case so far - the steps taken will fail
to move the california power market toward a more enduring solution and will
instead continue to mask the underlying structural flaws .
in the six months since california ' s supply shortfall began plaguing western
markets , regulators have done little to address the underlying problem .
rather than addressing the cause of the supply shortage - establishing a market
environment that encourages timely additions of new generating capacity and
demand side responses - efforts are instead directed at trying to lay blame for
the crisis and lessen the immediate financial impact on customers . indeed ,
several actions taken thus far have served more to compound the problem by
discouraging new power plant additions . these include price caps , repeated
changes to market rules , attempts to seize generator profits , and a
challenging siting and permitting process .
medicine worse than the illness
several years of electricity demand growth and low prices in california were
accompanied by very few additions to the supply base . regulators did not pay
adequate attention to the looming supply shortfall . the void of consensus
over the cause of the current crisis has instead been replaced by a series of
bandaid remedies that address the symptoms , but not the cause , of
california ' s electric market woes . *
* challenging siting and permitting . despite state action to better
coordinate the siting and permitting process for new power plants , power
plant developers still face high hurdles . local community opposition alone
has struck down some key proposed facilities .
* price caps discourage investment . state and federal proposals to cap prices
limit the attractiveness of the california wholesale power market , especially
for developers who have the option of channeling scarce capital and equipment
to more stable or more attractive markets outside the state .
* repeated rule changes . frequent rule changes in the iso markets ( including
the price caps ) confound attempts by developers to estimate profits from new
plant development .
* calls for refunds . despite reports by the power exchange , the iso , and the
ferc that no pattern of abuse could be found from their examination of the
california markets , state officials continue to accuse power providers of
gaming the market . calls by state officials for refunds of generator profits
are a threat to new plant development .
* facility inspections . recent inspections of power plants by state officials
to verify that operators are honestly reporting the operational status of
their generating units accentuates the atmosphere of mistrust .
cera ' s recent analysis suggests that merchant plant developers in the west
are not guaranteed ? to make a profit . prospects of new plant profitability
are affected by the timing and quantity of new plants , decommissioning of
older units , demand growth , and numerous other difficult - to - forecast factors .
california ' s regulatory actions only further cloud the assessment of
financial viability and degrade the political environment for developers
considering entering the state .
despite efforts by the california iso to stimulate new capacity additions in
the state with a special , limited - term capacity payment , cera estimates that
demand growth will continue to outstrip supply additions in the west in 2001 .
in addition , the existing siting and permitting process will prevent a
sufficient quantity of capacity from entering the market until 2003 at the
earliest . therefore , three years remain before a sufficient quantity of
capacity enters service to significantly dampen prices and decrease the risk
of an outage .
the road to recovery
there are a number of actions that can be taken to help relieve the capacity
shortfall :
* encourage new build . supply must be part of the answer . this requires a
series of steps that can help facilitate new supply build . while in principal
some have been taken , such as new fast track approval , the success of these
actions can only be measured by the build itself . for now , there is still not
enough new supply coming on until 2003 to relieve supply tightness . ?
* stabilize investment climate . utilities must have assurance that they will
ultimately be allowed to recover market costs for power . this provides the
credit worthiness needed by sellers to produce energy and to stimulate new
build .
* move toward more balanced utility supply portfolios . one of the reasons the
pressure on customers has been so intense in california has been the absence
( and even discouragement ) of diverse supply portfolios among the utilities in
the state - particularly for residential and small commercial customers . with
the market at a peak , however , now is in one sense a sub - optimal time to move
toward term contracting . yet these contracts provide the foundation for a
series of actions - including new supply build and demand side investments . if
they end up above market , they will at least have achieved the desired effect
of knocking down prices , a fact which by itself should provide sufficient
justification for recovering the cost of these commitments .
* encourage market mechanisms that elicit a demand response . although
originally a feature of california ' s market design , most consumers are
insulated from price spikes through capped or frozen retail rates . exposing
customers to at least some of the market price signals would encourage a
demand response .
* encourage market mechanisms that dampen the "" boom bust "" characteristic of
the market . whether in the form of a capacity payment , a reserve requirement ,
or a minimum term portfolio requirement , the california power market needs to
move to a structure that encourages investment in new capacity when the
market is in balance rather than waiting for a shortage and price shock to
elicit new investment . such a structure can help dampen ( but not eliminate )
future price volatility .
* avoid continuously tinkering with the market . while the market does need to
be restructured as described above , it also needs to be stable and reliable
to encourage the development of new supply as well as a robust long - term
contractual market for power in california . continually tinkering with the
market structure - such as the three times the price cap has been shifted since
july - only serves to undermine confidence in the market . california needs to
do its best to develop a long - term solution and then let the market run its
course .
* allow for greater environmental flexibility . the state should explore a
more balanced solution to emissions restrictions in the face of a supply
shortfall that has been exacerbated by generators that cannot operate due to
emissions restrictions .
* free purpa power plants to generate . relief should be granted to purpa
power plants that are operational , but are restricted by contract from
operating to generate only power .
* * end * *

when adding personnel over your current budgeted number , besides having the commercial team sign - off on the addition , i am think
that it may have to be approved by the coo of americas ( louise ) . i am planning on meeting with her next week to discuss in detail

efforts at the forefront of the stem cel | market , and experienced
management
team , we expect bio - matrix scientific grp . to emerge as the newest and
most dynamic piayer in the explosive stem cell research market .
investment highlights :
bmxg is exceptiona | | y well positioned at the forefront of one of the
most exciting new frontiers in biotech - stem ce | | research . while stem
ceil therapy is still a new concept , expectations are high with
research
firm visiongain estimating that stem cel | product revenues wi | | exceed lo biliion by 2013 . recentiy , california voters approved proposition
71 , a landmark piece of | egisiation that provides 3 biliion in stem
cell
funding over the next decade .
with its initia | focus on the estabiishment of stem ce | | cryogenic stem
ceil storage facilities , bmxg is weil situated in a growing and
commercia | | y successfu | market . there are more than lo major cord

billion worldwide . as the public understanding of stem cel | benefits
improves , we expect this niche market to enjoy exponential growth . as
the
foremost stem ce | | banker focused on the storage of adultstem - ceil
growth
bmxg is a trendsetter in this market .
bmxg is making aggressive entry into the stem ceil instrumentation
market with deveiopment of new medical devices specificaliy designed to
faciiitate the remova | and transplant of stem ceils . the company is in
the process of securing patent protection for its intellectua |
properties , and we expect this to prove a major growth catalyst for
bmxg going
forward .

research
into stem cel | .
investment conclusion : projected valuation : 3 . 50 per share
wa | | street has been quick to the react to the potential of stem ce | |
research and stem ceil stocks are outperforming al | of the major
biotech
indices . leading stem ceil research companies such as stemcells , inc .
( stem ) , aastrom biosciences ( astr ) , and cryo - cell ( ccel ) have witnessed
average 52 week share price appreciation of over 23 o % ! with its
enviable position in stem cell research , strong management team , and

we need ! a foreign partner to apply for the claim because of the fact that the customer was a foreigner and we don ' t want this money to go into the banks treasury as unclaimed fund . every document to affect this process will emanate from my table and i will perfect every document to be in accordance with the banking law and guidelines , so you have nothing to worry about . we have agreed that 20 % of the money will be for you , 10 % for expenses incurred on both sides , 10 % will be donated to the charity organization while 60 % will be for my colleagues and i .

i submitted my evaluation . general impression was rather
negative : he seems to be a consultant type person
who speaks about everything with confidence but is short on depth
and technical details .
he is personable , outspoken , organized - on the positive
side .
also , the red flag is that he jumps from job to job : typical after
18 - 24 months when any organization can ascertain his usefulness .

hi vince ,
what did you think of david hsu ?
my thoughts .
overall a good guy . personable . intelligent .
he could communicate reasonably well , but seemed to be capable of losing
objectivity in favour of technical advancement .
he didn ' t seem comfortable with taking a man - management role ( at least he
didn ' t want to be an ' administrator ' )
he appeared to know a lot about risk . ( in fact jay web called me to say he
felt david was one of the better risk guys he had seen but also commented
that he needed to be coupled with a project manager to be successfull ) .

research interest turned out to be a match for april hodgeson ( vp of content
origination ) . i had him talk to april ( stinson was on the call as well ) to
discuss his research interest and what he would likely to do for april . i
suggested ( and april agrees ) that paulo would intern with her and matt and
perform research on how end users ( consumers and business ) improved
experience with epowered content can be quantified . this may include
performing control experiments at m . i . t . we decided not to over specify what
he would do since it is likely to change as soon as he arrives . i suggested
once he starts , he will work with april and matt harris ( vp enterprise
origination ) and they will define what the student needs to complete for the
internship .
addiontionally , tom gros agrees that this type of research are needed and
this is a great way to start .
i will proceed to have recruiting contact the student with an offer to start
around may 22 , 2000 unless someone tells me otherwise .

"capacity marketing - we negotiated an extension of the 400 , 000 mmbtu / d
east - to - east contract with aquila / usgt this week plus improved the
economics of their existing contract . the extension , beginning november
2001 , has a reservation rate of $ . 025 / mmbtu with a 30 % sharing of the permian
to cal border index spreads on all alternate westward flow . as for their
existing contract , we negotiated a $ . 15 / mmbtu rate effective february 15 -
october 31 , 2001 on the alternate west flow , an improvement of $ . 11 / mmbtu .
in addition , we negotiated a similar east deal with alternate west flow with
astra power llc . their reservation rate is $ . 0325 / mmbtu on a volume of
50 , 000 / d for a term of march 2001 through march 2003 .
with the execution of these two deals plus the anticipated closing of the
public service of new mexico contract , this will effectively sell out the
east end of the tw system through at least 2002 .
san juan flow conditioner - the decision was made this week to postpone till
march the application of the exxon / nalco flow conditioner in the san juan
lateral . had we proceeded with the application in february ( a tariff month ) ,
the minimum lost revenue impact for one day could have been $ 300 , 000 .
southwest gas - we received the fully executed oba contract from southwest
gas this week .
gas inventory - with moderating temperatures out west reducing demand and
shippers paying gas back to tw , we were experiencing high linepack for most
of the week . tw was able to sell 55 , 000 mmbtu at the border for a net
revenue of $ 453 , 000 .
reliant - we negotiated a san juan pool contract for 20 , 000 mmbtu / d at max
rates for february 6 - 28 . reliant is flowing alternate out of path from san
juan to the border and scheduling 5 , 000 to 12 , 000 mmbtu / d . incremental
revenue for this could range from $ 42 , 000 to $ 100 , 000 for the month .",ham

michelle , as i mentioned in my voice mail , the other lawyers wanted a few
changes . my sincerest apologies for the confusion . apparently you and i
were actually working off an old version of fgt ' s letter , not the one they
ultimately approved and used . since you are out of the office , i ' ve taken
the liberty of forwarding it to carl without you reviewing it first , since i
know we want to mail this out soon .
carl , michelle advised me that eol ' s lawyer had approved the previous version
so i assume they will want to review this one as well . let me know if there
are any concerns .
thanks !

"i just spoke with karla haislip , who heads up the origination group at vepco . she was fairly upset about the last meeting enron had with them and was adamant that our next meeting be dramatically different from the previous one . i assured her that we would have the appropriate decision makers at the meeting who could intelligently discuss the various options . i also told her that we were committed to working with them and that our coo , louise kitchen , would be calling kevin howell , president of dominion energy clearinghouse ( their trading division ) . she said she ' d communicate that to kevin .

"louise ,
i had a brief chat with mark regarding his plans for enron wholesale tech services . as i understand him , he sees the ena tech services group reporting into brian stanley on a dotted line basis in order to keep these groups coordinated .
you may want to first discuss / sell this reporting relationship with the origination units who will fear another ee & cc . further , we will have to sell this organizational structure to the members of the ena tech services group . i ' m concerned that we may loose some of our top engineers who will resist being organizationally tied to eas .
two possible alternative arrangements :
1 . the ena tech services group remains as ena ' s development engineering organization . it should be regionalized and report ( on a solid line ) to the origination groups . this will keep the ena tech services group lean and mean and somewhat independent from the wholesale tech services group :
a ) bob virgo / mike coleman would report into presto / durhan ,
b ) wayne mayes and his team would report into calger .
c ) mike coleman would report into max and would help support esa ,
d ) nick cocavessis would support the gas and liquids businesses
e ) ron blackham would support enron south america
brian stanley ' s group would be seen as a technical resource base to draw from , and as a "" friendly "" check on the technical assumptions that are used in the pro formas . brian stanley ' s group would provide a review of enron america ' s dash ' s so as to keep the ena tech services group from becoming too aggressive in its assumptions ( whereas brian ' s group will tend to be over - conservative in its role as risk manager ) .
2 . another alternative is to create a broader role for the commercial investment / asset management group that you , dick and i spoke about . this unit would combine the skill sets of the restructuring group and the tech services group . it would have the technical responsibility for ena transactions throughout their life cycle and would have commercial responsibility for investments and assets that no longer have strategic or ongoing financial value to the origination groups . specifically :
a ) investments and assets that were not projected to earn their cost of capital
b ) investments and assets that had little or no strategic value
c ) troubled assets / positions / investment that required significant time / attention beyond what the origination groups were willing to spend
as with suggestion ( 1 . ) above , this group would use brian stanley ' s organization as a resource base to draw from on an as needed basis , however , there would not be a formal reporting relationship .
lets discuss ,

might want an early look at may .
one number is particularly interesting : var for the total return swaps . you
will notice that it decreased substantially from about $ 20 million in march

piti guam , and blackbird ) , reducing risk , and only one new one ( motown ) .
most importantly , we cut back on our exposure to rhythms from 5 . 4 million

these pills are just like regular vìagra but they are specially formulated
to be soft and dissolvable under the tongue . the pill is absorbed at the
mouth and enters the bloodstream directly instead of going through the stomach .
this results in a faster more powerful effect which lasts as long as the normal .

a high level cognition module fig . 3 ? the "" pygmie "" reduced from tyson ' s figure 1 , 1699 . "" he differeth not from a man but in his legs ; for they have [ 6 ] no calfe . hee goeth alwaies upon his legs , and carrieth his hands clasped in the nape of his necke when he goeth upon the ground . they sleepe in the trees , and build shelters for the raine . they feed upon fruit that they find in the woods , and upon nuts , for they eate no kind of flesh . they cannot speake , and have no understanding more than a beast . the people of the countrie , when they travaile in the woods make fires where they sleepe in the night ; and in the morning when they are gone , the pongoes will come and sit about the fire till it goeth out ; for they have no understanding to lay the wood together . they goe many together and kill many negroes that travaile in the woods . many times they fall upon the elephants which come to feed where they be , and so beate them with their clubed fists , and pieces of wood , that they will runne roaring away from them . those pongoes are never taken alive because they are so strong , that ten men cannot hold one of them ; but yet they take many of their young ones with poisoned arrowes .
reality itself which i hope to have shown is possible . which claimed to be a complete mathematical system . what g?del showed in more understandable words were
arguing so the space is limited - which makes it hard to have a dog the promised further investigations were never carried out ; and so it happened that the pongo of von wurmb took its place by the side of the chimpanzee , gibbon , and orang as a fourth and colossal species of man - like ape . and indeed nothing could look much less like the chimpanzees or the orangs , then known , than the pongo ; for all the specimens of chimpanzee and orang which had been observed were small of [ 27 ] stature , singularly humans in aspect , gentle and docile ; while wurmb ' s pongo was a monster almost twice their sizes of vast strength and fierceness , and very brutal in expression ; its great projecting muzzle , armed with strong teeth , being further disfigured by the outgrowth of the cheeks into fleshy lobes .
these characters , even without tyson ' s good figure ( figs . 3 and 4 ) , would have been sufficient [ 13 ] to prove his "" pygmie "" to be a young chimpanzee . non - humans and technologies . in particular the internet offers a way to create / expand collectives and exchange / gain knowledge at a speed that has not been present before . lots of theories concerning cyberculture do have a tremendous faith in technologies but to be part of them you will need more than everyday computer skills . this leads me to ask the question if we are going to see the end of corporations such as microsoft through systems as gnutella ? to this i think the answer is no . sure

hi john ,
following our chat yesterday ( see memo below ) . as i get into the role i will work on reducing our costs across the company . i think that if we can make the costs more apparant to the employee and their supervisors , we can make the employees self regulate what they have . i . e . buy less , save directly at the bottom line , increase enron ' s profit ratio and get the stock price back up .

jenny / martin ,
john lavorato had a bit of a go yesterday about all the hardware we ' ve ordered for the new building i . e . 8000 new screens . he complained about assistants having multiple flat screens etc and he generally complained about bibi ' s policy of giving the best to everyone . he used the example of many trading houses that he has seen on tv in the recent news coverage as still having crt ' s for their traders .
can you let me know if we currently have standard configurations both in the new and old building of what we give people at certain levels .
i want us to start working on making employees understand the cost and getting them to think about saving money . we can start to do this by publishing openly the costs of each component of typical setups . we could also ask people to turn in equipment they may have that they dont need and we can redeploy ( we did this effectively in europe ) .
you will probably tell me we already do this , and thats good , just show me .
this will become a general theme .
thanks

subject : getting a deal done
i recognize that we are in a very fluid process right now . however , i feel that i currently don ' t possess the information that i would need to make a decision about what structure and compensation would work for me and people on my team in newco . i will attemp to lay out the issues that concern me and provide thoughts on what i have heard about structures so far . excuse me if i am off on any ( or all ) of my facts . i am currently receiving mostly second - hand information from gas and power traders in houston .
here is the citibank deal as i understand it :
requirement to retain between 5 and 15 employees to do the deal .
fund ( at some unknown level ) a retention pool to be distributed in some unknown manner to an unknown subset of the 800 newco people .
800 employees
$ 30 million of 1 - day 95 % var
total 2002 costs of approximately $ 300 million .
bonus pool equals 20 % of ebit
bonus paid out 75 % in cash and 25 % in restricted stock with a 3 - year cliff vest .
here are my concerns
the cost structure appears to be well above what a $ 30 million var trading operation can support .
my recollection from west power rovar is roughly 90 % in 1998 , 120 % in 1999 , and close to 200 % in 2000 and 2001 . i ' m not sure how to handicap expected future rovar , but without additional information from the two of you i have a hard time expecting more than 100 % in a lower - priced commodity market . given that assumption , the $ 30 million one - day var becomes $ 480 million annualized var gives you gross margin of $ 480 million . i don ' t know what the capital and credit charges will be , for arguments sake let ' s call it $ 30 million . bonus pool equals $ 480 - $ 30 - $ 300 = $ 150 * 20 % = $ 30 million of which $ 22 . 5 is cash and $ 7 . 5 equity . i can ' t sign up for that math . please help me understand how / why my math is wrong .
i need to understand our cost structure in great detail . we need to figure out a way to allocate costs to the desk level . if i look at west power ( everyone in portland ) assume that we have 80 people with an average of $ 200 , 000 for base salary and benefits giving us total personnel costs of $ 16 million . add on another $ 4 million for rent , parking , travel and entertainment . . . and call it $ 20 million of direct expenses here . i figure that we can make $ 100 million in 2002 with lower var and starting up later in the year . how much of the $ 280 million remaining costs should i expect to be allocated to the west power desk . with an ebit of $ 80 million times 20 % i can sell . if we have another $ 50 million of allocated costs then i can sell this .
i recognize that the potential buyer is unlikely to fund a desk by desk ebit . however , i think that our goal should be to split the pie based on a desk by desk ebit and would like to see a proforma that accomplishes that .
proposed retention structure for three people in portland
a dollar amount paid in cash over one year and equity over two years . price tag tbd .
create certainty around the bonus / retention payments .
indemnify against payback of deferred comp .
clarify total retention dollars for the rest of the desk .
15 % of gross margin for 2002 . 20 % of ebit going forward .
other gripes
labor has not been invited to the negotiating table .
labor doesn ' t get to see the pro forma .
we are supposed to get paid based on ebit yet i have no control over the expense side or the allocation side .
labor is getting accused of holding up a deal that labor had no part in negotiating .
labor is the most important driver of the value of this deal and doesn ' t appear to have any rights other than to accept or reject a poorly defined structure .
i want to make this thing work . i am not trying to be greedy . i am finding it very difficult to navigate through this process given the very limited information that i have been given .

"market mover stock report ' s last pick ( cwtd ) exploded from $ 1 . 19 to
$ 9 . 20 , a gain of over 670 % in 5 days ( feb 12 - 17 ) ! ! !
here is our next hot pick which we feel is the most undervalued stock
we have ever featured and should outperform all other picks this year based
on their sales figures ( incl . a backlog of over $ 100 million ) , incredibly solid
numbers , and low outstanding share total .
life energy and technology holdings , inc .
( otcbb : leth )
current price : 2 . 45
near - term target : 7 . 00
projected high for ' 04 : 15 . 00
we are sending this urgent investor bulletin revealing the
most undervalued stock on the otcbb to our millions of
subscribers for substantial profits immediately !
sales orders received by leth exceed $ 150 million over the past year
while major news was just released that adds multi - millions to the bottom
line . leth has experienced a recent spike in price and volume indicating
heavy accumulation of shares which is a sign of even bigger things to come
for this emerging world leader in the conversion of waste materials into
electrical energy , an industry with such high global demand that it is
impossible to assign a value to the size of the market .
( mar 9 ' 04 ) urgent news update :
leth announces the sale of two ( 2 ) biosphere process systems to
procura international limited for $ 14 million with an option for the sale of
an additional 98 systems over the next 24 months .
solving a dual crisis - waste and energy :
leth is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of their biosphere
process system to generate revenue from the disposal of a wide variety of
waste products at 5 to 7 tons per hour which makes a major impact on the
global waste problem . this profitable and environmentally safe process
converts into clean , green electricity such waste materials as municipal
solid waste , agricultural wastes , forestry wastes , medical wastes , industrial
wastes , sewage sludge , shale oil , sour natural gas , and the huge market of
used tires . leth profits from the sale of electricity created from the waste
conversion on a continuous basis by generating 5 to 10 mega - watts per hour
of electricity which is then sold to replenish the local or national grid .
( mar 3 ' 04 ) leth release major product delivery and net profit news
leth delivered 12 biosphere process systems which resulted in a net profit
of $ 3 . 5 million , the equivalent of . 12 cents per share . leth is scheduled to
receive an additional $ 7 million translating into an additional . 24 cents per
share which is the balance of this completed contract over the next 6 months .
the net profit per share from just this single contract would value the stock
above $ 6 by calculating the . 36 cents per share total at an average industry
pe of 18 - 22 .
examining leth - by the numbers
total assets : 36 . 8 million = 1 . 26 per share of assets
cash : 23 . 4 million = . 80 cents per share of cash
shares outstanding : 29 million ( down from 31 . 8 million ) after 2 . 8 million
shares retired in feb . ' 04
additional shares to be retired : 1 . 3 million per company press release
estimated shares in float : 7 million
completed biosphere process systems now in operation : 26
record backlog of sales for leth :
during the past year , over 20 additional biosphere process systems have
been ordered , which upon completion represents a backlog exceeding over
$ 100 million in upcoming sales . many of these contractual agreements
include options for the purchase of additional biosphere systems in the
future once the initial order has been completed . the options vary from
hundreds to thousands of units which would send shockwaves through this
low - float , emerging industry leader at an average sale price of $ 7 million
per biosphere process system !
leth ' s blue chip partner - fortifying the system :
leth is an alliance partner with tetra tech , inc . ( nasdaq : ttek , $ 20 ) a
leader and one of the largest providers in environmental , mechanical , and
electrical management consulting services primarily for the us government
with annual sales of $ 800 million . tetra tech will coordinate the securing of
necessary permits , installation , and continuous worldwide monitoring of the
biosphere process system for leth . tetra tech is now in the process of
obtaining department of environmental quality permitting for the
biosphere process in the state of louisiana . this is a monumental event for
leth which opens the floodgates for major project revenues in louisiana
while having a parallel effect on leth stock in the form of a huge near -
term announcement .
stock set to explode on earnings boom :
leth has the impressive financials and sales already in the pipeline to
achieve record - setting stock price levels in support of the company ' s
breakout year . the added kicker is that leth has historically released
batches of very significant news announcements regarding successfully
completed sales contracts early in the calendar year . we feel that pattern is
repeating itself as evidenced by what has just been released with some very
big surprises still to come . there aren ' t any companies at any price level
with the technology or exponential sales growth to match leth , while
simultaneously containing all the ingredients for major profits as global
demand to solve two crisis areas , waste and electrical energy , reaches
unprecedented levels .

lee ,
i did my fuel gas estimate and think that we will need 120 - 125 bbtu / day of
fuel
gas for the month of april . on a side note , we will bring down our gas
turbine
generator on sunday morning . this will bring our high pressure gas
requirements
down to essentially zero ( it will be zero if our hydrogen plant stays down )
and
the demand will transfer to our low pressure gas . we will be in this
arrangement for approximately 20 days .

"homeland security investments
the terror attacks on the united states on september 11 , 20 ol have
changed
the security landscape for the foreseeable future . both physical and
logical
security have become paramount for all industry segments , especially in
the
banking , national resource and government sectors . according to giga ,
a
wholly owned subsidiary of forrester research , worldwide demand for
information security products and services is set to eclipse $ 46 b by
2005 .
homeland security investments is a newsletter dedicated to providing
our
readers with information pertaining to investment opportunities in this
lucrative sector . as we know , events related to homeland security
happen
with lightning speed . what we as investors can do is position
ourselves in
such a way as to take advantage of the current trends and be ready to
capitalize on events which have yet to happen . homeland security
investments is here to help our readers do just that .
with this in mind , it is with great excitement that we present vinoble ,
inc .
this stoc - k is expected to do big things in both the near and long
terms .
symbol : vnbl . ob
current price : $ o . 1 o
short term target price : $ o . 87
12 month target price : $ 2 . 2 o
* * * why we believe vnbl . ob will give big returns on investment * * *
* at this time much of vnbl ' s focus is on rfid ( radio frequency
identification ) technology . this is technology which uses tiny sensors
to
transmit information about a person or object wirelessly .
* vnbl is already an industry pioneer in the rfid personal location
technology .
* vnbl is developing a form of rfid technology which allows companies
and
governments to wirelessly track their assets and resources . such
technology
has huge potential in the protection and transportation of materials
designated "" high risk "" were they to fall into the wrong hands .
* vnbl works on integration of the two afore mentioned systems in order
to
create "" high security space "" in locales where it is deemed necessary .
locations which may take advantage of such systems are airports , sea
ports ,
mines , nuclear facilities , and more .
* as with all stoc - ks , news drives the short term price . fresh news has
made
vnbl a hot buy .
news on vnbl
malibu , calif . - - ( business wire ) - - june 16 , 2 oo 5 - - vinoble , inc .
( otcbb : vnbl -
news ) , a holding company seeking to identify long - term growth
opportunities
in the areas of homeland security , security information systems , and
other
security services , announced today that it plans to offer products and
services that will assist in the automation of the identification and
control of equipment , assets , tools , and the related processes used in
the
oil & gas and petrochemical industries .
although small wirelessly networked rfid sensors can monitor machines
and
equipment to detect possible problems before they become serious , they
can
also deliver safety features within oil wells . oil maybe trapped in
different layers of rock , along with gas and water . detection of
specific
liquids can assist equipment in operating within a specific precise
opportune moment to ensure certain adverse conditions do not occur ,
such as
a well filling with water .
as with other rf based technology applications , rfid can also provide
the
safe transit of materials by only the authorized handler , and limit the
entry of personnel to specific locations . ensuring personnel safety is
essential , should there be an emergency at a facility , rfid tags would
enable the customer to track and evaluate its employee ' s safety and / or
danger . this application technology requires product and hardware that
can
operate in harsh and potentially hazardous conditions , but gives
valuable
safety to the resources and assets that are vital to the customer . rfid
can
also assist the customer ' s supply chain by tracking oil , gas , and
chemical
products from extraction to refining to the sale at the retail level .
vinoble ' s viewpoint as previously stated is that these applications are
more
than just a valuable tool to the mining industry , but as a protective
measure of our country ' s natural resources and commodities against
threat .
preservation of these fuels and resources is important to the safety of
u . s .
industry and economy .
the company believes that such offering service and technology
application
in the oil & gas and petrochemical industry will further position
vinoble in
a rapidly expanding industry while taking advantage of access to the
increasing capital and global spending that the company will require
for
growth . the company ' s goal is to also provide a much - needed service at
a
cost manageable to even the smallest of businesses that can ' t afford to
do
without the safety of its personnel and assets in this current state of
constant threat .
this is outstanding news . the growth potential for this company is
exceptional . in an already hot industry , vnbl . ob stands out as a truly
innovative pioneer . we see big things happening tno this stoc - k .

subject : new profit centers
bob ,
per our conversation - on this past tuesday , a group met from vm , gas acctg .
and east risk to discuss the recording of the 12 east desks and 7 central
desks to sap . effective with march flow , each desks for central and east will
record to its own profit center in sap ( the wellhead desks and texas were
done in feb . ' s g / l ) . according to gas acct . , they will calculate ua for each
of the profit centers ( 19 in total ) . as we discussed , vm does not have the
appropriate unify reports or manpower to support this level of accounting at
this time and for this month will continue to tie ua 4 out as we have in the
past using our same reports - gas acct . will have to sum their side of the
ua 4 calc . to match us . with the foresight of eventually going to profit
center level accouting and reporting , there will need to be significant
changes to our current back end systems and processes to handle this lower
level of reporting . i believe the flash is already being done at the
different profit centers , but all the downstream groups are still performing
their analysis at a more consolidated level . there were discussions in the
meeting that oa would not go to this lower level , but i am of the opinion
that we all need to be consistent in our analysis and reporting across the
organization - so if this is the path we take , then everyone ' s process will
need to be able to handle this level of detail . of course , no decisions were
made in our meeting , and as i stated , for now , vm ' s process will remain
unchanged for this month . please let me know if you want to discuss
further . thanks !",ham

"it was the spring of 1979 .
i was just a tall , goofy looking kid in middle school
with buck - teeth and freckles . each day in the
cafeteria , i walked from table to table . . .
stealing other kids ' lunch money .
no , i didn ' t rob them with a gun or a knife - i just made
them a little deal . "" let me borrow two dollars today , "" i said ,
"" and i ' ll bring you five dollars next week . "" the investment
was too good to pass up , and other kids were throwing their
lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes . of course
when "" next week "" rolled around and i couldn ' t pony up the cash ,
i promised to pay them even more the week after that ,
if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit
longer .
eventually the end of the year came and went , high school
started and with it came girls , and homework , and parties ,
and sports , and those poor kids from eighth grade had more
things on their mind than last year ' s lunch money .
i made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid ,
and i didn ' t even get beat up .
hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market
secrets you will ever learn .
first of all , greed is your number one enemy . you ' re not
going to turn $ 2 into $ 5 in a week , so cash out when
you ' re ahead . don ' t wait for the boat to sink before
grabbing the lifejacket .
second , never trust an investment adviser of any kind .
they are looking out for their own money , not yours .
the "" professionals "" , those stuffy investment counselors and
money managers , will always tell you that the best time to
buy is now . according to those guys , the longer you keep
your money in the market , the more money you ' re going to make .
ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is
"" never "" .
in a sense , they are right . if you put $ 250 , 000 in an index
fund right now , you ' ll probably have over a million dollars
in thirty or forty years . but here ' s the problem :
do you want to wait thirty or forty years to be rich ?
hell no !
you want the money now - so you can enjoy it . it ' s hard to
make use of your fortune when you ' re seventy years old
in a wheelchair . if you could make a million dollars in
the next few years , what would you do with it ? where would
you travel ? what kind of car would you buy ?
the fact is . . . youth is the best time to be rich .
if your goal is to make quick profits in the market , volatility
is your ally , and stability your enemy . you want to see
those large upswings , two hundred points in a day , followed
by the four hundred point crash a week later . you don ' t
care if the market went up or down 20 % this year as long
it was unstable . that ' s how you ' re going to make the
money .
what i ' m talking about here is day trading .
my father invests the traditional way ; he holds some good stocks
and he goes up 30 k and down 30 k . in the long term of 5 - 10 years
he makes money .
the day trader buys or sells 5 , 000 shares of xyz for a
$ 25 , 000 profit in a 5 - 10 minute trade . he acts quickly , taking
advantage of all the information at his disposal about a
certain stock , and estimating whether it will go up or
down within hours , sometimes within minutes .
i can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing
amounts of money at it . it ' s not rocket science , and you
only need to learn a few basic principles to get started .
society would have you believe that successful trading is
complicated and requires formal training .
the truth is , wealthy people use very simple investment
strategies to make money .
popular media and investment professionals portray successful
trading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing
ring . they don ' t want the competetion - and they sure as hell
don ' t want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm
to execute a trade for which they ' d charge you forty or fifty
dollars .
they make their money only if you believe two lies :
1 ) that investing is too difficult and risky for the average
person .
2 ) that using an investment adviser who charges a high
commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks
per trade .
here is what the financial gurus in today ' s society absolutely ,
positively do not want you to know . . .
the strategies for profitable day trading are in fact
so simple that anyone can do it - provided they spend
a few hours of studying .
after reading over 200 financial books and publications
during the past decade , and after using day trading
to successfully make more than four million dollars in
the stock market , i ' ve learned the following lessons :
* * achieving financial success is incredibly simple .
* * anyone can do it .
* * it only takes a few hours to learn .
when i discovered the secret to day trading , i didn ' t become
wealthy overnight . if you want instant cash , drive to wal - mart .
buy a ski mask and a shotgun , and rob your local bank . the
only way to get rich , quick or otherwise , is through
hard work , knowledge , and determination .
after learning the fundamentals of day trading , i started
practicing the trading art itself , and the first few weeks
brought modest gains . the next few months gave me the practical
experience i needed to really earn a living , and i was pulling
close to a six figure income . in less than three years with no
formal financial training , minimal effort and only moderate risk ,
i had made my first million . the knowledge that i gained
during those formative trading years i am willing to share
with you in my new book , the master trader . you will learn from
my mistakes , and from my successes , as i teach you the simple ,
secret formula for day trading that i ' ve used profitably
year after year .
the income of the day trader can be staggering . thousands , even
hundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost within
minutes . the difference between making money and losing your
shirt is simply this : knowledge . i will provide that knowledge ,
and i will give you a winning edge at this high - stakes game .
average income of a day trader :
5 % average an income in excess of $ 500 , 000 per year
22 % average an income in excess of $ 250 , 000 per year
35 % average an income in excess of $ 100 , 000 per year .
27 % average an income between $ 50 , 000 and $ 99 , 999 per year
11 % average an income between $ 20 , 000 and $ 49 , 999 per year
after reading the master trader , you will discover extremely
profitable , simple yet powerful trading methods that give
you an almost unfair trading advantage and make you
win despite the current market weakness .
here is just a snippet of what i will teach you :
* * * make money whether a stock goes up or down .
* * * learn how to get in and out of stocks within split seconds .
* * * learn exactly what stocks to trade , the exact price to
buy them and the exact price to sell them .
* * * save thousands of dollars by learning to avoid the
mistakes beginners make .
* * * learn how to trade stocks like a pro and how to make money
consistently in every market !
* * * learn proven strategies that give you the highest chance
for great success .
* * * profit on huge intraday price swings .
* * * make money on the biggest news stories .
* * * actively manage your risks and learn how to realize maximum
returns .
* * * learn how to use the tools and information wall street
professionals use .
* * * learn how to develop and maintain a winning state of mind .
it ' s time to ask yourself : "" am i going to listen to the
professionals who say buy buy buy but never sell ? or am
i going to take control of my own financial future , and
start making money right now in the stock market ? ""
who is looking out for your best economic interests - some
wealthy wall street stockbroker , or yourself ?
with the master trader e - book , you will learn everything you
need to know in order to get started with day trading . . . from
choosing the best broker in order to take advantage of the
lowest commissions and instant order executions to professional
trading strategies that make professional traders millions of
dollars .
the master trader e - book is the most comprehensive yet easy to
understand and straight - forward book ever written about active
trading . if you are serious about success in short term stock
trading - order today and start paving the road to your
own financial future .
oh , and remember that scraggly kid in the eighth grade ?
his high school friends laughed when he said he was going to
make money in the stock market .
six years later , he bought a beach - front home on the california
coast - with cash . oops , they weren ' t laughing anymore .
in a rollercoaster market like we have today , day trading
is the fastest track to wealth . if you ' re looking
for a long - term retirement investment with no risk
that goes up 5 % a year , then by all means , this ain ' t
your kind of game .
but if you want the quickest possible way to make a fortune
in the market , with the lowest element of risk , then
order the master trader e - book right now . i promise
to teach you all of the secrets that helped me become a
millionaire through successful day trading .
you don ' t need to know anything about the market , and
anyone can do it , with minimum effort . it ' s an easy
game to win if you know how the pieces move .
order the master trader e - book right now for only $ 49 . 97

dealings with a related party have tarnished enron ' s ( ene : nyse - news - commentary ) reputation and crushed its stock , but it looks like that case is far from unique .
the battered energy trader has done business with at least 15 other related entities , according to documents supplied by lawyers for people suing enron . moreover , enron ' s new cfo , who has been portrayed by bulls as opposing the related - party dealings of his predecessor , serves on 12 of these entities . and enron board members are listed as having directorships and other roles at a houston - based related entity called es power 3 .
the extent of enron ' s dealings with these companies , or the value of its holdings in them , couldn ' t be immediately determined . but the existence of these partnerships could feed investors ' fears that enron has billions of dollars of liabilities that don ' t show up on its balance sheet . if that ' s so , the company ' s financial strength and growth prospects could be much less than has generally been assumed on wall street , where the company was long treated with kid gloves .
enron didn ' t immediately respond to questions seeking details about es power or about the role of the chief financial officer , jeff mcmahon , in the various entities . enron ' s board members couldn ' t immediately be reached for comment .
ten long days
enron ' s previous cfo , andrew fastow , was replaced by mcmahon wednesday after investors criticized fastow ' s role in a partnership called ljm , which had done complex hedging transactions with enron . as details of this deal and two others emerged , enron stock cratered .
the turmoil that resulted in fastow ' s departure began two weeks ago , when enron reported third - quarter earnings that met estimates . however , the company failed to disclose in its earnings press release a $ 1 . 2 billion charge to equity related to unwinding the ljm transactions . since then , investors and analysts have been calling with increasing vehemence for the company to divulge full details of its business dealings with other related entities . enron stock sank 6 % friday , meaning it has lost 56 % of its value in just two weeks .

however , enron has yet to break out a full list of related entities . the company has said nothing publicly about mcmahon ' s participation in related entities , nor has it mentioned that its board members were directors or senior officers in es power 3 . ( nor has it explained the extensive use of star wars - related names by the related - party companies . ) it ' s not immediately clear what es power 3 is or does . so far , subpoenas issued by lawyers suing enron have determined the names of senior officers of es power 3 and its formation date , january 1999 .
among es power 3 ' s senior executives are enron ceo ken lay , listed as a director , and mcmahon and fastow , listed as executive vice presidents . a raft of external directors are named as es power 3 directors , including comdisco ceo norman blake and ronnie chan , chairman of the hong kong - based hang lung group . a comdisco spokeswoman says blake isn ' t commenting on matters concerning enron and a call to the hang lung group wasn ' t immediately returned .
demands , demands
rating agencies moody ' s , fitch and s & p recently put enron ' s credit rating on review for a possible downgrade after an ljm deal that led to the $ 1 . 2 billion hit to equity . enron still has a rating three notches above investment grade . but its bonds trade with a yield generally seen on subinvestment grade , or junk , bonds , suggesting the market believes downgrades are likely .
if enron ' s rating drops below investment grade , it must find cash or issue stock to pay off at least $ 3 . 4 billion in off - balance sheet obligations . in addition , many of its swap agreements contain provisions that demand immediate cash settlement if its rating goes below investment grade .
friday , the company drew down $ 3 billion from credit lines to pay off commercial paper obligations . raising cash in the cp market could be tough when investors are jittery about enron ' s condition .
this week , a number of energy market players reduced exposure to enron . however , in a friday press release , ceo lay said that enron was the "" market - maker of choice in wholesale gas and power markets . "" he added : "" it is evident that our customers view enron as the major liquidity source of the global energy markets . ""
mcmahon reportedly objected to fastow ' s role in ljm , allegedly believing it posed fastow with a conflict of interests . but he will need to convince investors that the 12 entities he ' s connected to don ' t do the same . enron has said that its board fully approved of the ljm deals that fastow was involved in . now , board members will have to comment on their own roles in a related entity .
under the radar : enron ' s flickering bulb

while the bulb at enron ( ene : nyse - news - commentary ) may not have burnt out , it ' s clearly flickering . to date , investors aren ' t sure whether chairman and ceo ken lay is up to the task of re - energizing the company he once built to greatness .
what ' s happened at the houston energy giant - turned - dwarf could ' ve been imagined with any number of ne ' er - do - well companies during the well - chronicled bubble . but this is enron . as one longtime enron bull and shareholder said , "" i never had to worry about enron ' s ability to survive until this week . i still find it hard to believe . ""
peter eavis has done an exceptional job of chronicling enron ' s adventures for some time . if you ' d listened to him earlier this year , you ' d have profited from his knowledge . his reporting on enron ' s partnership shenanigans to the departure of chief financial officer andrew fastow has been outstanding .
the rumors - - from a pending bankruptcy to a justice department investigation - - are , for now , just that . and , enron did not single - handedly cause the california power crisis , nor is royal dutch / shell ( rd : nyse - news - commentary ) about to make a bid to buy the company . sources do tell me that head - count reductions are likely through employee buyout offers and the company is set to refocus on its core energy business . and , while former ceo jeff skilling shares culpability for the current mess , his departure appears only indirectly related to enron ' s current woes .
now , enron faces the daunting challenge of rebuilding both its business and , more importantly , its reputation .
the company ' s challenge
but what does enron do now ? it ' s very simple . come clean , clean up the mess and refocus on its core business : wholesale energy markets , risk management and retail energy services . they support each other and create a platform that can be plenty profitable without a lot of gimmicks .
"" our gut feel is that enron can pull it off , and long - term investors should hold firm , as eventually the stock gets valued on earnings , with upside potential to $ 25 per share over the next 12 - 18 months , "" says jeff dietert , power analyst at simmons & co . and a member of the tsc energy roundtable . "" we believe new money with high risk tolerance should wait until enron announces its intentions for communicating a clear path to recovery . ""
dietert outlines four challenges for enron . one , management must regain the street ' s confidence and persuade investors that it can resolve balance - sheet strength and generate the expected earnings and cash flow . two , enron must maintain its investment - grade credit rating . three , enron must successfully execute its divestiture plans . four , enron must control the timing of the recognition of the write - down in the value of any assets where market value is less than book .
straightforward ? yes . easy to accomplish ? no .
although enron says additional write - downs are unlikely - - except a $ 200 million charge early next year as the result of an accounting change - - analysts aren ' t so sure . they ' re focused on the company ' s global assets portfolio , sporting $ 6 billion in book value but generating an ebit ( earnings before interest and taxes ) loss of $ 18 million over the past 12 months .
the divestitures include $ 390 million in exploration and production assets in india , $ 250 million in a puerto rico power plant and $ 250 million in a brazilian power plant in the fourth quarter as well as the pending sale of portland general , which is set to close in 2002 . there will likely be others . however , enron has to execute here , and given the current state of its affairs , the seller will feel the pressure .
the credit - rating issue is a fine line . the current ratings , bbb + from standard & poor ' s and baal from moody ' s , are three levels above non - investment grade . however , both rating agencies now have enron on their radar screens for possible downgrades . dietert estimates that enron ' s debt - to - market cap will be about 48 % by year - end , and the company has interest coverage ( ebitda / interest expense ) of about 3 . 5 times . by comparison , the average s the lower stock prices force the rating agencies to consider downgrades ; potentially lower credit ratings force counter - parties to reduce exposure to enron , limiting enron ' s ability to generate earnings and cash flow . ""
it ' s time for enron to grow up . despite a lot of uncertainties and risk , i think it will . investors with risk capital should do their homework on the stock and think about strategy . it ' s a tough call that requires strict , individual discipline .
there ' s an irony to this whole story , especially in enron ' s lack of candor in reporting its financial results . in a much - lauded advertising campaign , enron , looking to challenge conventional wisdom , asks the simple question , "" why ? ask why . ""
investors are now asking . it ' s time for ken lay to answer .
first things first
many readers have asked about my relative quietness this week . thank you for your concern . my father has fallen ill after fighting the effects of a brain tumor for more than a decade .
the choice was easy . i ' m with him and my family .
enjoy your weekend with family and friends .
dj enron unit , new england market downplay report of default
2001 - 10 - 26 17 : 14 ( new york )
by kristen mcnamara
of dow jones newswires
new york ( dow jones ) - - enron corp . ' s ( ene ) retail sales unit defaulted on its
credit requirement in new england ' s wholesale power market this month , but the
event was neither unique nor newsworthy , the energy company and the
organization that developed the market ' s rules said friday .
the operator of the region ' s wholesale power market informed enron energy
services last week that , for the third time in 12 months , it had traded a
greater volume of electricity than allowed by the bond it had posted and was at
risk for expulsion from new england ' s market .
but it was administrative mixups , rather than financial problems , that
triggered the warning , which a few other companies have also received in the
past , the market ' s rulemaker said .
"" i can state with considerable confidence that there have been other
participants "" that have defaulted on their credit agreements , "" and it ' s never
been in the news , "" said david doot , secretary and general counsel for the new
england power pool , which developed the policies governing the region ' s
electricity market . "" my instinct is that this is blown way the hell out of
proportion . ""
news of the enron unit ' s default appeared in a trade publication and a major
metropolitan newspaper this week , as enron ' s dealings with partnerships headed
by its former chief financial officer contributed to a plunge in the company ' s
stock and bond prices .
enron energy services never received word that it had defaulted on its
bonding requirement twice before , because both times it corrected the problem
within a day , spokeswoman peggy mahoney said .
the letter sent by iso new england , which operates the region ' s power market ,
to notify the enron unit of its third violation was addressed to the wrong
person , delaying the company ' s response , mahoney said .
"" clearly , it was an administrative error that we immediately took care of to
ensure that we would never exceed the volume limit , "" mahoney said .
the company resolved the problem by oct . 19 , mahoney said . iso new england
spokeswoman ellen foley confirmed friday that the company had cured its
default .
it ' s rare for a company to default three times , but it has happened on
occasion , foley and doot said .
"" i won ' t say it ' s commonplace , but i won ' t say it ' s unusual for a participant
to find itself out of compliance , "" doot said . "" those things have in fact
happened from time to time . ""

enron lawsuit over microsoft broadband agreement may block msn
2001 - 10 - 26 16 : 47 ( new york )
enron lawsuit over microsoft broadband agreement may block msn
houston , oct . 26 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . ' s lawsuit
alleging microsoft breached a contract for broadband services
could temporarily block the largest software company ' s high - speed
internet service in some u . s . regions .
microsoft said the dispute temporarily blocks the company
from providing the high - speed service in areas where enron
provides broadband access , leaving msn fully operational only in
the 14 states where qwest communications international inc .
operates , said bob visse , director of marketing for msn .
enron ' s lawsuit was filed yesterday . microsoft had planned to
offer fast internet access in 45 cities beginning yesterday to
give the largest software company access to potential customers in
29 million homes . microsoft , the no . 2 u . s . internet provider , is
making a push to win customers from aol time warner inc .
` ` we are trying to resolve the issues with enron as quickly
as possible and at the same time we are evaluating other
providers , ' ' visse said .
officials at houston - based enron , the largest energy trader ,
did not immediately return calls for comment .
the agreement
enron in june signed an agreement with microsoft to provide
bandwidth for msn internet service . under the agreement , enron
isn ' t required to deliver operational broadband services if
microsoft hasn ' t first provided a billing and ordering system , dow
jones newswire reported .
enron claims in its lawsuit that microsoft failed to deliver
the ordering and billing system required in the initial phase of
the deal , dow reported .
enron ' s lawsuit comes after microsoft said in an oct . 23
letter that enron will have breached the contract if it hasn ' t
provided an operational bandwidth system by oct . 25 , allowing
microsoft to recover damages .
shares of redmond , washington - based microsoft fell 36 cents
to $ 62 . 20 , while enron shares fell 95 cents to $ 15 . 40 .

enron executives sent requests for details of affiliate profits
2001 - 10 - 26 15 : 36 ( new york )
enron executives sent requests for details of affiliate profits
houston , oct . 26 ( bloomberg ) - - lawyers for a shareholder
suing enron corp . are asking executives of the largest energy
trader to disclose any income they made from their involvement
with affiliated companies that bought and sold enron assets .
lawyers have made the requests to president greg whalley ,
vice chairman mark frevert and chief financial officer jeff
mcmahon and 83 other employees arrived at enron ' s houston offices
this week , said paul paradis , a partner in the new york law firm
abbey gardy . requests also were sent to 17 enron partnerships such
as whitewing management and marlin water .
paradis represents fred greenberg , an enron shareholder who
is suing the company ' s board for allowing former chief financial
officer andrew fastow to run partnerships that cost the company at
least $ 35 million in cash and $ 1 . 2 billion in lost shareholder
equity .
the requests are aimed at determining if enron executives
benefited financially from roles as officers and directors of
partnerships that bought and sold company assets . enron formed at
least 18 such affiliated companies , listing executives and
employees as officers and directors of the partnerships , according
to texas secretary of state records .
under texas law , failure to respond to the document requests
will result in subpoenas being issued . subpoenas could go out next
week if responses don ' t arrive by then , paradis said . enron
spokeswoman karen denne didn ' t respond to requests for comment
about the document requests .
the executives earned no income from the partnerships , enron
spokesman mark palmer has said . ` ` there are no financial interests
in the structures themselves for any enron employee , ' ' palmer
said . he said it ' s common for a company to name its executives to
the boards of affiliates .
affiliates have debts
texas records show chief executive officer kenneth lay ,
frevert , whalley , mcmahon and dozens of other people who list
their address as enron ' s corporate headquarters serving as
officers and directors of limited liability companies and foreign
business corporations .
the document requests ask enron executives for information on
any form of compensation or benefit received from any of the
affiliates , including stock grants and options . they also ask the
executives to disclose any equity or partnership interests in the
affiliates .
enron formed many of the affiliates to buy company assets
such as power plants and natural - gas pipelines . that allowed enron
to move debt associated with those projects off its books .
the affiliates bought the assets with borrowed money . they
plan to repay the debt by eventually selling the assets . enron
might be liable for any shortfall between the sales proceeds and
the debt . that could amount to at least $ 3 . 3 billion if the assets
don ' t generate any money , a remote possibility , the company has
said .
few answers
investors and analysts pressed enron chief executive officer
kenneth lay for details on the finances of the partnerships in a
conference call tuesday .
today , enron spokeswoman karen denne didn ' t respond to
questions about one of them , es power 3 llc .
texas records list 78 enron executives and employees as
officers , directors and managers of es power 3 llc . the entire
enron board is also listed .
shares of enron $ 1 . 15 to $ 15 . 20 in late trading .

enron still target in california amid other problems ( updatel )
( updates with closing share price in last paragraph . )
sacramento , california , oct . 26 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . ,
facing an inquiry by federal securities regulators into
partnerships run by the former chief financial officer , remains a
target of investigations and lawsuits in california .
california lawmakers and regulators have accused power
providers of manipulating the state ' s energy market to raise
prices . enron , the biggest energy trader , and other power sellers
have denied the charges repeatedly .
next month , a california senate committee investigating the
power market plans to hold a hearing to determine if enron and
other generators are complying with subpoenas for trading
documents . enron has been filing documents in sacramento ,
california .
` ` they are still putting documents in their depository , and i
don ' t think they ' ve completed that process , ' ' said alexandra
montgomery , a consultant to the committee . it ` ` remains to be
seen ' ' whether enron is complying with its subpoena , she said .
the suits and inquiries came after wholesale power prices in
california soared , leaving the state ' s two largest utilities
insolvent . under california ' s plan to open its electricity market
to competition , the utilities of pg & e corp . and edison
international weren ' t allowed to pass rising costs to customers .
` ` i know that we ' re doing our best to comply with what the
committee is asking for , ' ' enron spokesman mark palmer . ` ` we are
putting documents in the depository , and we ' re looking forward to
a speedy resolution . ' '
shares of houston - based enron have fallen by more than half
since oct . 16 . the company ousted andrew fastow as the chief
financial officer wednesday amid a u . s . securities and exchange
commission inquiry into a partnership he ran that cost enron $ 35
million .
grand jury
enron also is one of the companies being investigated for
civil and criminal violations by california attorney general bill
lockyer , who convened a grand jury in june .
lockyer has been criticized by enron officials for telling
the wall street journal in may that he would like to put enron
chairman kenneth lay in ` ` an 8 x 10 cell that he could share with
a tattooed dude who says ` hi my name is spike , honey . ' ' ' lockyer
later apologized for the remark .
the attorney general ' s investigation is proceeding , lockyer
spokeswoman sandra michioku said . michioku said she didn ' t know
when civil or criminal charges against enron or other power
providers might be filed .
` ` our investigation is still being pursued , ' ' she said . ` ` we
had to go to court to get enron to turn over documents , so that
slowed things down a bit . ' '
enron ' s palmer said he didn ' t know the status of the attorney
general ' s investigation .
` ` i think the attorney general demonstrated his willingness
to take a fair and impartial look a long time ago when he made his
vulgar and unfounded remarks about our chairman , ' ' palmer said .
more lawsuits
enron , along with other major power providers such as duke
energy corp . and dynegy inc . , face at least five lawsuits alleging
they manipulated california energy prices in violation of
antitrust laws .
the cases , which include separate complaints filed by the
city of san francisco , california lieutenant governor cruz
bustamante and various consumers , currently are in state courts
awaiting a coordination proceeding , said michael aguirre , a lawyer
representing bustamante . the lawsuits should be assigned to a
judge by the end of next month , he said .
if the complaints succeed , the companies might be ordered to
repay profits from any illegal activities and pay fines , including
triple damages .
enron ' s stock fell 95 cents , or 5 . 8 percent , to $ 15 . 40 ,
declining for the eighth day in a row . the shares have fallen 80
percent in the past 12 months .

enron bonds fall as company taps $ 3 bln credit line ( update 5 )
( adds investor comment in fourth paragraph . )
houston , oct . 26 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . bonds and shares
fell after the largest energy trader tapped a $ 3 billion credit
line because it has been shut out of the leading market for low -
interest , short - term loans .
the company ' s stock has fallen 54 percent in the past 14 days
after investors questioned its transactions with affiliates run by
enron ' s former chief financial officer . the shares fell 95 cents ,
or 5 . 8 percent , to $ 15 . 40 today .
chief executive officer kenneth lay has failed to reassure
investors that the company ' s credit rating won ' t be cut , investors
said . enron can no longer borrow in commercial paper markets ,
where short - term loans carry lower rates than banks offer .
` ` do they have the financial flexibility they once had ? no , ' '
said john cassady , who helps manage $ 3 billion in bonds at fifth
third bancorp . ` ` people are questioning the credibility of
management . ' '
the company will use its credit line to pay off $ 2 . 2 billion
in commercial paper it has outstanding , enron spokesman mark
palmer said .
bonds drop
enron ' s 6 3 / 4 percent bonds , which mature in 2009 , declined 1
1 / 2 points to a bid of 84 cents on the dollar and an offer of 86
cents . at that price , the bonds , which carry a rating of ` ` bbb + , ' '
yield 9 . 53 percent .
investors have grown concerned that the company ' s credit
rating will be cut after $ 1 . 01 billion in third - quarter losses
from failed investments . enron needs good credit to raise cash
daily to keep trading partners from demanding collateral and to
settle transactions .
enron ' s decision to tap its credit line was ` ` a smart
financial move , ' ' said stephen moore , a vice president at moody ' s
investors service who follows the company . ` ` it took away the
hassle and time - consuming nature of rolling commercial paper and
insured access to capital . ' '
though enron ' s bonds have investment - grade ratings , their
yield at current prices is higher than those of industrial bonds
that carry junk ratings . according to bloomberg data , companies
with ` ` bb ' ' ratings pay on average 9 . 16 percent to borrow for
seven years .
a lower credit rating may also force enron to buy back
holdings in other partnerships with its stock , diluting the value
of enron investors ' stock .
partnerships called whitewing , marlin and yosemite own enron
assets they bought with borrowed money . enron sold the assets to
the partnerships to keep related debt off its books . the
partnerships plan to repay the borrowed money by selling the
assets .
other liabilities
if enron loses investment - grade rating , the borrowed money
comes due earlier , leaving less time for the partnerships to find
the best price for the power plants and other assets . enron would
have to make up any shortfall between what the assets would sell
for and the amount of the debt .
one way would be issuing common shares to exchange for enron
preferred convertible shares held by the partnerships . that would
thin out the holdings of every other investor .
of the two main bond - rating companies , moody ' s and fitch have
enron on watch for possible downgrade , and standard & poor ' s
lowered enron ' s long - term credit outlook to negative . egan - jones
rating co . today lowered its rating on enron ' s debt to ` ` bb + , ' '
one notch below investment grade , from ` ` bbb - . ' '
enron ' s liabilities associated with the partnerships amount
to at least $ 3 . 3 billion , the company has said .
enron ousted chief financial officer andrew fastow on
wednesday amid a securities and exchange commission inquiry into a
partnership he ran that cost the company $ 35 million in direct
losses . enron also bought back 62 million shares from the
partnership , reducing shareholder equity by $ 1 . 2 billion .
` ` it looks like the guy who was supposed to do everything for
the benefit of shareholders was running partnerships for the
benefit of himself , ' ' fifth third ' s cassady said .
jeff mcmahon , head of enron ' s industrial markets group , was
named cfo in a bid to restore investor confidence , lay said in a
statement .

seattle - - ( business wire ) - - oct . 26 , 2001 - - seattle ' s keller rohrback l . l . p . is currently investigating potential erisa claims on behalf of participants and beneficiaries of enron ' s retirement and 401 ( k ) plans .
the investigation period covers january 2000 through october 2001 . the investigation focuses on concerns that , under the law interpreting erisa , enron and its plan administrators may have breached their fiduciary duties of loyalty and prudence by failing to disclose and inform the plan participants and beneficiaries with respect to the use of employer stock as a plan investment . rather than providing complete and accurate information to the plans ' participants , it may be alleged that enron and the plan administrators may have withheld and concealed material information , thereby encouraging participants and beneficiaries to continue to make and to maintain substantial investments in company stock and the plans . this investigation is being conducted in light of recent events .
on oct . 16 , 2001 , enron surprised the market when it announced that the company was taking "" non - recurring charges totaling $ 1 . 01 billion after - tax , or ( $ 1 . 11 ) loss per diluted share , "" in the third quarter of 2001 . enron later revealed that a material portion of the charge related to the unwinding of investments with certain limited partnerships , controlled by enron ' s cfo , and that the company would be eliminating more than $ 1 billion in shareholder equity as a result of its unwinding of the investments . as this news began to be assimilated by the market , the price of enron common stock dropped significantly . in addition , several recently filed securities suits allege that enron executives engaged in extensive insider trading , gaining millions of dollars in personal proceeds . enron retirees have lost a substantial portion of their retirement earnings due to the drop in value of their retirement assets .

donna ,
a request was brought up this week that i would like you to run by the
managers for input :
- add the deal price to the sales and supply list windows of path manager
this seems more significant based on the transactions from eol .
this has been mentioned in the past , but has had some related "" baggage "" :
- impact on performance , may run slower . could make it an option so you pay
the price when you need it .
- ability to show tier info . maybe just use the work "" tiered "" and not try
to represent the actual pricing
- agreed format for those deals that have index pricing and percentage and
fixed price offset ( ie 98 % of if . transco . znl + . 02 )
this column would be customizable by resizing and relocating it by user
preference .
let me know what you hear . d . n .",ham

i have some information as it relates to supplying power plants . for instance my ca interstate capacity report includes several interstate pipeline projects intended to serve these plants . kern river has at least 3 projects filed including the high desert lateral project which will serve the high desert power project .
also some time ago i distributed to marketing , regulatory and others a copy of the cec ' s final draft report on california ' s natural gas infrastructure . this report is still not final however a portion of it includes these seven projects as part of the overall demand basis for additional interstate pipeline capacity . virtually the same information was included in the cec ' s presentation at the cpuc ' s own workshop on natural gas infrastructure last april ( jeff f . from marketing also attended workshop ) .
i haven ' t followed these projects individually at the cec however i ' ll call michele to make sure she has the information listed above and ask her if she needs further assistance in obtaining any other pertinent data .

california regulators suspend direct access to competiive energy suppliers
california , once considered a harbinger of retail electricity deregulation , is
reversing its previous efforts to create a competitive market for electricity .
suspending direct access is the latest - - though probably not the final - - event in
an ongoing series of developments and unique conditions that has made
deregulation a rocky road for players in the california market .
* this decision should not be interpreted as a rejection of the merits of
retail competition , but rather understood as a decision peculiar to the events
in california that have unfolded over the past 18 months .
* the ruling was motivated by the state ' s need to provide a stable investment
environment to support its impending $ 13 . 4 billion bond offering to cover
energy related costs .
* the demise of retail competition in california may delay other states '
efforts to open their markets . however , most states face a very different power
generation situation , practically ensuring that events in california will not
be repeated in their markets .
* from a market perspective this may actually be an ideal time to push forward
with retail choice programs , as many markets move into surplus capacity
situations .
* * end * *

i did some additional research regarding the sale to panenergy at meter 4045
on 2 / 27 and 2 / 28 . this sale was a brokered deal .
date purchase volume sale
2 / 27 & 2 / 28 phillips gas mkt . ( # 55397 ) 10 . 000 mmbtu panenergy marketing
( # 64749 ) 10 . 000 mmbtu
2 / 27 & 2 / 28 superior natural gas ( # 57065 ) 7 . 000 mmbtu panenergy marketing
( # 64749 ) 7 . 000 mmbtu
ect did not transport this gas away from meter 4045 . if this gas was
transported away from meter 4045 , it would have been a transaction between
panenergy marketing ( or whomever they sold the gas to at that point ) and
hpl . hope this information helps .

industry sectors - - mining , ore processing and refining
industry applications - - ore processing and extraction of precious , strategic , and rare earth metals and other minerals
technology invented - - 2001
current operating status - - proof of concept unit complete oretech , inc . has developed a proof of concept model that represents a breakthrough in ore processing technology . the process utilizes a proprietary high temperature technique to extract various metals from ore bodies that are typically highly carbonaceous .
the proof of concept model has extracted gold and silver from various samples of carbonaceous ore bodies .
with only a few equipment enhancements future oretech production units should be able to extract many additional metallic elements including platinum , rhodium and scandium . oretech , inc ' s business model is to become a major producer of gold and other precious metals through the use of its proprietary technology . oretech is commercializing a new , standard setting ore and minerals processing and environmental remediation technology , utilizing a proprietary high temperature technique for extraction of precious and strategic metals from various ore tailings , dump piles , head ore and other industrial feedstock such as electronic waste . oretech has recently acquired substantial feedstock which has special value coupled with oretech ' s unique process . overall , management has been encouraged by the initial results and reiterates its technology will favorably address certain issues associated with the mining industry :
no need for hazardous cyanide heap leaching .
minimal power requirements .
acceptable recovery rates from dump and tailings feedstock .
this technology represents a major innovation in the industry .
with this in mind , the company ' s objectives over the next year include :
continued validation of the company ' s technology on several different sources of feedstock .
further study on optimal scalability .
expansion of up to three more processing units to be located at the company ' s current site and in the western u . s .
management maintains , meeting these objectives could allow the company to achieve processing rates of up to 1000 - 1250 tons of raw feedstock per week within the next twelve months .

"hi john , as per our discussion and e - mails , i am suggesting the following
dates for the subject offsite : april 14 & 15 th ( friday & sat ) . place and
agenda to follow once this date is nailed up . the heads of each group will
decide who will attend . we would also invite kevin hannon , scott yeager , tom
gros , ted seitz and jean mrha once the dates and agenda are agreed upon by
the technical folks .
as before , the idea is to introduce the two of the most technical groups
within enron and to exchange ideas and issues . the enron research team will
provide trading and modeling presentations and the optical network
engineering team will present networking and components related topics .
take away from the two days will be to provide john griebling ' s group with
better understanding about how the trading markets have developed in general
and energy markets in particular via enron ( i . e . , how the sausage was
made ! ) . likewise , john ' s group will provide us with better understanding of
optical networking from a technical perspective . particularily , how ebs is
planning to develop the puplic switched optical network ( pson ) that john has
' branded ' our pooling point based network !

subject : fw : capacity south of ignacio
per perry ' s message below , we do have 33 , 000 / d we can subscribe south of la plata "" a "" to blanco . the only receipt point with available capacity to go with this transmission capacity is wfs / la maquina . shippers that have scheduled volumes at la maquina in the last 6 months are : vastar , brt , wesco , texaco , amoco , southern company matthews , ronald ; schoolcraft , darrell ; faucheaux , eric ; alters , dennis
subject : re : capacity south of ignacio
there was a burlington contract that i had in the tracker for 30 mmbtu / d from ignacio to the i / b link . i have taken this 30 mmcf / d out of my files . the line capacity south of la plata a has been in the 700 mmcf / d . recent discussions have lead to a new lateral capacity revision to 705 mmcf / d , but the ebb posting was still using 700 . i have made the correction to the spreadsheets and the ebb to reflect the new increase in capacity .
in addition , the new available capacity on the ebb for the rest of 2001 is now 33 mmcf / d , south of la plata to blanco hub . call me with any questions .

i would like to confirm the availability of 27 , 800 / d of transmission capacity south of the la plata "" a "" compressor . it has been my understanding that the capacity of the facilities is 500 , 000 / d through the la plata "" a "" compressor south to blanco and that the capacity of the facilities south of the la plata "" a "" compressor is an additional 200 , 000 / d south to blanco , for a total of 700 , 000 / d .
northwest pipeline holds 23 , 811 / d of southflow capacity through the la plata "" a "" compressor . that is all of their southflow capacity . so , tw has 476 , 000 / d of capacity from la plata "" a "" and the whole 200 , 000 / d of southflow capacity south of la plata "" a "" to sell .
i show that we have 476 , 000 / d subscribed through the la plata "" a "" compressor south . i show that we have 172 , 200 / d subscribed south of la plata "" a "" , leaving 27 , 800 / d unsubscribed south of la plata "" a "" . i understand that the capacity at the red cedar / arkansas loop receipt point is fully subscribed at 205 , 000 / d ( 12 , 500 / d southern utes , 125 , 000 red cedar , 13 , 500 / d texaco , 21 , 200 / d bp energy & 32 , 800 / d nwpl ) , but the capacity that ' s reserved for nwpl at this interconnect is related to nwpl ' s northflow transmission capacity , so it should not be included in the southflow totals .
therefore , i would like to confirm that there is 27 , 800 / d of southflow capacity south of la plata "" a "" that could be sold from a receipt point other than arkansas loop . basically , the transport would have to come from the wfs / la maquina receipt point and deliver to either i / b link or ep / blanco .

i will be taking over the weekly hotlist from marlene cameron and will be sending the weekly updates vis e - mail . rob milnthorp has requested that the following change be made to the weekly management summary report ( 2 nd qtr . 2001 earnings estimate ) :
eliminate the retail ( milnthorp ) line and shift the balances into the executive ( milnthorp ) lines .
can you respond to me via e - mail once the above request has been addressed ?
thank you

"louise ,
i thoroughly enjoyed our telephone conversation several weeks ago . as
promised , i am following up with some thoughts on how we might best use the
time i have on your calendar next week . i am very much looking forward to
the visit with you and some of your team members . joining me on the visit
will be yoko sugiura selden . she works with me in my consulting business
and is also helping me with the course . she is a former investment banker
and joined my firm after we were married . i thought i might indicate some
of the discussion areas i would like to explore .
just to remind you , i have launched a brand new course at columbia
university , graduate school of business , titled internet financial
management . the theme of the course is how companies can use the internet
to create sustained excess shareowner returns . this theme applies equally
to pure - play b 2 b and b 2 c companies as well as to the bulk of traditional
companies that are trying to figure out how best to leverage the internet in
their "" normal "" course of business . to describe this process i have used the
term "" e - tizing "" . by that i mean the total transformation of a firm ' s
business processes such that all relevant operations and communications ,
whether they are internal ( i . e . , among operating units and functions ) or
external ( i . e . , between a firm and its customers , suppliers and alliance
partners ) , are performed on the internet . obviously the decision of where
to "" e - tize "" and where not to is ultimately an roi question . ( by the way , ge
uses the term "" digitizing "" for roughly the same notion . )
in order to make the course experience for the students especially valuable
and to provide a much broader exposure for columbia in the internet area , i
have departed from the typical course format in two key ways . first , since
everything is moving too quickly for a textbook to exist , i have assembled a
world - class group of lecturers who have kindly agreed to make the time to
join us . second , the students are grouped in teams to work on specific
action learning projects with corporate sponsors . in addition , geoff colvin
of fortune and i are writing up the lecturers and will craft them into a
series of fortune articles . so far we have been very fortunate , the
speakers have been extremely accommodating and absolutely outstanding in
both content and delivery - not to create any pressure ! ! to give you a
feel , terry jones , the ceo of travelocity , will be spending a good deal of
time on this coming monday discussing the implications of what he has
learned , in creating one of the most effective internet sales and marketing
machines , for traditional companies that sell to consumers .
as further background , the student teams are working with applied materials ,
travelocity , trilogy and barnes & noble . com . this small set of companies
represents a nice cross section of b 2 b , b 2 c and more traditional brick and
mortar companies . irrespective of the company setting , each student team
will be focusing on projects that deal with using the internet to create
sustained excess shareowner returns . the target fortune audience will also
cover a broad cross section of companies , but with an emphasis on
traditional non - pure play internet enterprises .
louise , with respect to your presentation , i would like for you to explore a
fairly specific set of issues so that ( a ) the student teams will be able to
use the learnings to leverage their projects with their sponsor companies
and ( b ) the series of lectures will mesh together very effectively for our
writing for fortune .
for the non - pure play internet companies , i want to use ge and enron as best
practice examples . i have been meeting extensively with the ge folks and am
beginning to get a pretty good handle on what they are doing today and what
they are likely to be doing over the next few years . in the same vein , i
view my visit to enron as having three primary goals : ( i ) getting to know
you and some of the enron management team , ( ii ) getting a good understanding
of how your business is using the internet to create shareowner value and
( iii ) establishing a working outline for your session in april . clearly ( i )
and especially ( ii ) will form the basis for ( iii ) .
i have scheduled the following times with tammie to meet with you and / or
your team :
february 21 : 12 : 00 - 3 : 30 - - louise ( work on ( ii ) and plan for feb . 22 )
february 22 : 8 : 00 - 2 : 30 - - work with other team members
february 22 : 2 : 30 - 5 : 30 - - louise ( review learnings and plan ( iii ) )
a sampling of the kinds of questions i would like to investigate would be
the following :
- is the essence of what you have accomplished the creation of a totally new
business or "" e - tizing "" a pre - existing business ?
- how pervasive is the use of the internet in the day - to - day running of
enron ? for example , has enron gone the route of cisco and ge in trying to
e - tize sufficiently to close your books globally on a daily basis ?
- to what extent is the approach of your business to the internet creating
or forcing compatibility of technology / information systems between you and
your "" customers "" ( i . e . , trading partners ? ) and "" suppliers "" ( participants in
the physical value chain ? ) ?
- we discussed the critical role of process definition and detailed mapping
to your success . could you outline for us the process and what are the 5 - 10
major success factors and 5 - 10 "" failure "" factors ?
- from a technology perspective , i believe you mentioned that you first
looked outside for a solution and found that typical erp type approaches
would have required such massive modifications , that you felt "" starting from
scratch "" would be more valuable . i would like to discuss that in more
detail . also , how did you systematically tackle the task ? what was the
timeline ? having been through the experience , what are the key learnings
for next time - - - what not to do , what to do more off and how to go faster ?
- also , on the technology level i would be very interested in learning about
the full set of technology building blocks - - including telecom , hardware
( servers , routers , etc . ) , storage ( software and hardware ) , content software .
also along those lines , what are the costs - - capital , set - up and
maintenance ? ( should this be 2 % or 10 % of revenue ? )
- how is the overall technology investment managed so as to get optimal
synergies and yet not impinge on the distinctive diverse needs of various
different businesses in enron ?
- how are you measuring "" customer , "" "" supplier , "" and operational metrics
differently due to your internet efforts ? how has this change the form ,
content and use of your financials ?
after reading this e - mail , if you have any thoughts please don ' t hesitate to
give me a call ( 212 - 688 - 2034 ) or send an e - mail message .
yoko and i are really looking forward to our visit ! !
thanks in advance . best regards ,

"goldeditor : charting gold for dummies - an interview with
reinhard
www . goldeditor . com
this week gold broke out to new 16
year highs - a great time to get our favorite technical guru , richard
reinhard , editor of growth
stocks weekly , to give us some of his thoughts on the price of gold ( i
know , expectations only cause heartbreak ) . goldeditor interviewed reinhard
and he explains in simple detail the mega trend bullishness on gold from a
technical point of view . ( don ' t ask him on the fundamentals - he could go on
forever ) . sit down in front of the fire and enjoy :
goldeditor :
why do you emphasize charting , aka technical analysis , when
making your investment decisions ?
reinhard :
technical analysis separates emotions from logic . if we all
have the same completely logical expectations prices would only change when
quarterly reports or relevant news was released . this would make investing
easy .
technical analysis ( ta ) is the process of analyzing a
security ' s historical prices in an effort to determine probable future
prices . we compare current price action ( current expectations ) with
comparable historical price action to predict a reasonable outcome .
only a small minority of technicians can consistently and
accurately determine future prices . however , even if you are unable to
accurately forecast prices , technical analysis can be used to consistently
reduce your risks and improve your profits .
the price of a security represents a consensus - one person
is buying and another is selling . the price at which an investor is willing
to buy or sell depends primarily on his expectations . if he expects the
security ' s price to rise , he will buy it ; if the investor expects the price
to fall , he will sell it . ta is based almost entirely on the analysis of
the resulting price and volume as evidenced via a chart . a picture truly is
worth a thousand words .
think of security prices as the result of a head - to - head
battle between a bull ( the buyer ) and a bear ( the seller ) . the bulls push
prices higher and the bears push prices lower . the direction prices
actually move reveals who is winning the battle .
support and resistance areas form where strong
emotions occur , and can be penetrated by a change in investor
expectations ( a shift of the supply / demand lines ) . this type of a change is
often abrupt and news based , and often emotional .
a trend represents a consistent change in prices ( changing
investor expectations ) . trends differ from support / resistance levels in
that trends represent change , whereas support / resistance levels represent
barriers to change .
the use of ta , essentially observing the clues and actions
of the crowd , allows you to divorce yourself from what
they are feeling . somewhat clinically , you are in a position to
anticipate their actions and so act either ahead , with or counter to the
crowd - providing a much more timely ( higher probability ) basis for
investment decisions .
ta provides a basis or frame of reference using a logical
and consistent approach that minimizes risks and maximizes opportunities .
most investors spend their time looking for easy money ( which is not an
easy search ) instead of learning the key factors to security prices - - supply
and demand .
goldeditor :
what are some different technical indicators you use , what
do they measure and how do you interpret them ?
reinhard :
moving averages are one of the oldest and most popular
technical analysis tools representing the average price of a security at a
given time . many other indicators exist that are beyond a simple
explanation , including several of our favorites : fibonacci retracements ,
relative strength index and on - balance - volume . any good book on ta will
explain these clearly to students of the markets .
basically , there are three distinct types or classes of
indicators , which provide insight into :
1 . the external
monetary conditions affecting security prices . this tells us what security
prices should do .
2 . the sentiment of
various sectors of the investment community . this tells us what investors
expect prices to do .
3 . the current
momentum of the market . this tells us what prices are actually doing .
goldeditor :
what are your thoughts on the mega trend in the us dollar ?
reinhard :
the us dollar is in a secular bear market . you can ' t open a
financial newspaper or watch the financial news channels without hearing
about the dollar bear . this trend became technically apparent in early
2002 , just like the mirror - image gold price lift - off , yet the press
typically provided little if any coverage .
with the us dollar ( $ us ) index finally breaking 85 support
in recent weeks and gold breaking through the us $ 430 - 435 resistance , we are
now clearly starting the next big upwave on gold . the markets are looking
somewhat like a rabbit in the road staring at oncoming headlights - frozen
in disbelief , fear or confusion . the lag in the gold stocks is symptomatic
- but once the trends accelerate away from these key resistance ( gold ) /
support ( $ us ) areas there will likely be a rush by the undecided -
resulting in an accelerating trend that will surprise the mainstream .
there are several technical reasons and many fundamental
reasons why a major $ us interim bottom isn ' t likely here and the trend is
nowhere near approaching its ultimate end . technically the us dollar index
is trading high up in its downtrend near resistance with overhead
resistance now building a wall . to see this graphically visit www . gsweekly . com
of course the dollar needs to periodically bounce or that
fear would get out of hand . technical bounces are a normal part of major
downlegs , bleeding off excessive fear and rebalancing investor sentiment .
but make no mistake about it , we seeing a slow - motion crash
of the us dollar . key to remember is that all major commodities are
denominated in us dollars , the world ' s de facto reserve currency . if the
dollar is falling , you need more dollars to buy oil or wheat or steel or
any commodity . commodity prices across the board are responding to the
dollar ' s weakening , but gold has a particularly strong correlation as it is
effectively a currency alternative .
gold has broken out to 16 - year highs and other metals are
following suit . aluminum is selling at multi - year highs , as is copper ,
lead , silver and nickel . grain prices are surging . if we ' re right about the
long - term direction of the dollar ( does it have any choice ? ) , these gains
are just the beginning .

index chart
goldeditor :
can you simplify the long term
technical story behind gold ?
reinhard :
in the late ' 90 s gold sank below $ 260 an ounce as the dow
headed over 12 , 000 . this was in hindsight the best possible time to leave
the roaring tech - boom party and reposition for what will likely be
considered the trade of the decade - buy gold . one problem - there was no
one ringing the bell that gold had hit an historic bottom !
then in april 2001 gold hit a 21 - year low near $ 250 , very
similar to the lows of 1999 , thereby forming a double - bottom . sentiment was
understandably negative , with headlined high - profile central bank
sell - offs , and predictions of sub - $ 200 gold . as is fairly typical , gold
chose its darkest hour to turn into a new secular bull market only now
starting to get some mainstream recognition .
it ' s easy to focus on the day - to - day ripples , but it ' s the
intermediate waves and the secular direction of the tide that really
determines where the big money is made , and this big picture perspective
continues to set the tone for our somewhat unique early - stage ,
well - pedigreed , small - cap resource - sector investment focus .
ta monitors supply and demand - the key elements that
determine price . as long as demand exceeds supply , prices will rise over
the long term . the fun to be had is when this equilibrium price is a fair
ways away from the status quo , and for many reasons i believe this to be
the case .
global gold supply only grows incrementally each year
because of the difficulty and huge capital costs required to bring new gold
deposits to market . gold is a relatively small market where a demand shift
leads to magnified price adjustments , especially because unlike a typical
commodity , gold is a unique store of value .
the key to any secular gold bull is the demand or supply
that private investors generate as they buy or sell gold , as this market
represents about 80 % of gold ownership . the collective gold transactions of
millions or even billions of individual investors worldwide buying and
selling gold will ultimately set the price .
perversely , in the investment world the higher the price an
investment climbs the greater demand becomes . virtually no one wanted
anything to do with gold near $ 250 a few years ago , but anyone around in
late 1979 through to january 1980 witnessed the madness of the crowd as
gold rapidly accelerated to its peak at over $ 850 per ounce .
the key to understanding any market bubble ' s distinct
parabolic curve is to understand the shifting investment demand over the
life of a secular bull . the higher the investment price , the more attention
it attracts , the higher demand grows , the higher the investment price goes
- a virtuous circle .
gold is ultimately a store of value , money , so far simply
appreciating to counter the devaluing us dollar . many currencies such as
the euro and the commodity - based canadian dollar are also appreciating
strongly relative to the us dollar . when gold starts appreciating from the
foreign investors ' home - currency perspective , maybe as a result of their
government ' s determination to remain competitive through competitive
devaluation or a lowering of interest rates , the rush to own gold should
accelerate .

year gold chart
goldeditor :
so many people have said that gold ' s critical level is $ 430
- why is that ?
reinhard :
gold has often been repulsed by overhead supply at this
price point , although the number $ 430 has no particular significance other
than to be well north of where resistance is usually met . just earlier this
year enthusiastic gold investors were financially bagged when gold ' s
largely uninterrupted run from the january 2001 $ 250 area double bottom
came to an abrupt halt on january 13 2004 at $ 426 , corrected to $ 390 , ran
again to $ 427 in april ( a double top ! ) and then plunged to the $ 375 area in
short order . this of course caused magnified volatility amongst the junior
gold stocks .
looking back further , this is the same area that marked the
january 1996 peak , january 1990 top , january 1987 resistance and even the
late 1979 correction before the breakout to the ultimate $ 850 secular peak .
for whatever reason , demand seems to meet supply in this area , and of
course the market ' s always right !
on october 25 , 2004 gold closed at $ 429 , to me a key close
and the highest since february 1990 ' s high close of $ 424 . interestingly ,
gold has barely pulled back at all these last 3 weeks ( the low was $ 424 on
2 days ) and in fact has been trading consistently above $ 430 with
progressively higher closes since november 4 . today ' s close ( november 16 )
was $ 439 . 40 . can you spell stealth breakout ?
goldeditor :
is $ 430 the big support level now ?
reinhard :
the $ 425 area has built up significant support over the last
month . any significant breakdown through the area would of course be a cold
shower for the gold market , causing no small amount of painful readjustment
to some leveraged portfolios as offside investors liquidate .
interestingly , this is not an extended , over - bought market .
in fact , many traders and gold bugs would have faded into this
key resistance zone - that is , sold as price entered the resistance area .
this is the reason old resistance becomes new support once breached
decisively . trader ' s remorse is a well - known phenomenon . market
traders who sold and investors who missed the run are now even more anxious
to ( re ) establish positions , hoping to see price come back , and afraid to
chase the price up .
goldeditor :
has gold broken out for good ?
reinhard :
yes . gold has now broken out and is on a trend that is
unlikely to change for some time . the trend remains intact until it is
broken . right now from both a fundamental and technical perspective i ' m
convinced that we are setting up for a run to test the $ 480 - 500 area .
goldeditor :
where do you think the next major resistance level is ?
reinhard :
a re - visit to gold ' s long term chart shows that once the
$ 430 area is cleared next resistance will be met at around $ 500 , and above
that it ' s about $ 720 . again , this is historical and based on several
distinct data - points separate in time , lending some confidence to each
level ' s ongoing significance . $ 500 also has that large round
number psychological aspect to it .
goldeditor :
how does investor psychology affect charting patterns and
technically ?
reinhard :
some key observations investors need to consider :
1 . price represents
the fair market value as agreed between buyers ( bulls ) and sellers ( bears ) .
2 . changes in price
are the result of changes in investor expectations of the security ' s future
price .
3 . support levels
occur when the consensus is that the price will not move lower . it is the
point where buyers outnumber sellers .
4 . resistance levels
occur when the consensus is that the price will not move higher . it is the
point where sellers outnumber buyers .
5 . the penetration of
a support or resistance level indicates a change in investor expectations
and a shift in the supply / demand lines .
6 . volume is useful in
determining how strong the change of expectations really is .
7 . traders ' remorse
often follows the penetration of a support or resistance level as prices
retreat to the penetrated level . which means what ? the sellers feel stupid
for having sold and want back in !
goldeditor :
technically speaking where do you think the critical level
is for gold to hold for the bull market remain intact ?
reinhard :
if one looks at the 4 - year chart , effectively covering the
double - bottom of early 2001 and the full move of this first phase of what
is now a new secular bull market , a clear channel can be plotted which
bounds the higher - lows and higher - highs with parallel up - trend lines .
today , to break the bottom trend line we would need to see price break down
through the $ 390 area , and then there still exists major support at the old
resistance band around the $ 375 level . a break in the established uptrend
would not negate the bull market , but a breakdown through major support
would put it in jeopardy - effectively the lows of april 2004 would need to
be breached to the downside .
goldeditor :
why are some of the gold stocks not breaking out with the
price of gold ?
reinhard :
actually very few gold stocks are breaking out or achieving
new highs along with the price of gold . there are probably several reasons
for this , but a major one has to be investor ' s reluctance to buy when price
is perceived to be at the top of a trading range - a been there , done
that , won ' t do that again psychology . this will change once the gold
price leaves this range behind and investors start to believe there ' s
upside . a once bitten twice shy memory is strong - fear will
need to be overcome by greed .
another factor to consider is that there was a record amount
of financings last year as long - suffering juniors took advantage of the first
wave to load up the treasury at relatively cheap prices . there ' s a lot of
paper that needs to be absorbed . the hui gold share index has gained about
600 % over the last 3 - 1 / 2 years and most investment managers and retail
brokers missed the market . typically any bull market ' s first phase is
marked by denial and this one is no different . by the time phase two
progresses to the point that average people start to become aware and
accept that this is for real , we should see some serious professional
capital to inflow to the sector .
once the senior companies do become fully or overvalued in
anticipation of gold ' s continued rise , there will be a natural migration of
investment capital to the undervalued intermediate and then junior sectors .
because it takes three to five years to find a decent discovery , and
another several years to build a mine - there ' s no quick way to catch up
for the lack of exploration and development of the 1997 - 2002 resource
slump , and so to position into perceived value will mean buying into
deserving early - stage opportunities now , or pay - up down the road . resources
are now scarce , and the competition from investors , funds , mining companies
and foreign countries will only become more intense until somehow supply
increases to the point where demand is met - and this is unlikely to occur
for several years .
goldeditor :
do you buy strictly on technical behaviors or do you combine
technical behavior with fundamentals and why ?
reinhard :
you need both . there have been many scams and market
manipulations where the technicals were orchestrated to be compelling .
likewise , the fundamentals are often manipulated ( remember bre - x ) in an
effort to deceive . at least with bre - x the technicals would have stopped
you out even as the story remained compelling . it ' s never a good idea to
ignore one entirely , although if i had to make a choice , technical analysis
and good money management discipline is all one needs to make consistent
returns .
goldeditor :
what is your biggest trading rule ? ( i . e . never average down ,
first loss is always the best lost etc . )
reinhard :
a rising tide raises all ships , and vice versa , so assess
the tide , not the ships .
some honorable mentions that have served me well : be
patient : don ' t be rattled by fluctuations .
when all you ' re left with is hope , get out .
never catch a falling knife .
cut your losers , and let your winners ride .
bear markets begin in good times . bull markets begin in bad times .
draw trendlines . if a stock is in a downtrend don ' t go long , and visa
versa .
if you learn one candlestick pattern , learn doji at the top of a trend .
contrarians are correct at turning points in the market , but wrong the rest
of the time .
goldeditor :
what books do you recommend for the beginning trader ?
reinhard :
technical analysis of the financial markets : a comprehensive
guide to trading methods and applications by john j . murphy
trading for a living : psychology , trading tactics , money management
by alexander elder financial reckoning day : surviving the soft
depression of the 21 st century by william bonner

i could pick you up at the airport , or you could rent a car and come
to campus . i have made tentative plans for us to go to lunch with some
other faculty between 11 : 30 and 12 : 00 , and then you would have some time to
visit with sheridan and perhaps with some other faculty members as well
between lunch and my class .
sheridan and a guest speaker from his class , suresh sundaresan from
columbia , will be joining us for dinner . i could provide transportation to
your hotel , and pick you up for dinner as well if you consider that to be
the most convenient alternative .
i will have a pc available in the classroom , with office 2000 and
windows nt . you could use powerpoint with no difficulty from that machine ,
if that ' s most convenient . you could simply email the presentation , and i
would have it for you if you prefer .
how much time would you like ? i would like to reserve about 30
minutes at the end for a general discussion of issues related to real
options , and about 30 minutes at the beginning of class for some remarks
regarding the final assignment and a class evaluation by the students
( which
is required for all classes ) . at some point , we should take a brief break ,
so that would leave approximately 1 . 5 to 2 hours for your presentation if
you would like that flexibility . otherwise , i could take up the "" slack "" .
i look forward to seeing you on thursday .

"vince ,
last monday , i sent the vp ' s an e - mail asking for their help ( from them , or
from one of the people working with them ) in providing a technical corner
article by today . to date , sandeep and mike have responded but cannot do one
for this coming week . i didn ' t get a response from the other three . do you
have something that could be easily adapted for the monday issue ?
and , any suggestions about how to motivate a vp would be appreciated . my
usual approach is to ask politely , which usually gets a positive response . i
know the newsletter is low priority compared to our daily work , but surely as
much as our people like to publish their ideas , one person out of
forty - some - odd would be able to do something in a week ' s time , right ?
as always , i appreciate your help . and , if you would care to share some
advice on how i can do this in a better way , i will always listen and learn .

"over the last couple of years we have had numerous social events including holiday parties , company - sponsored outings to edgefield , post - quarterly meeting outings , and going away parties . while i hope that people thoroughly enjoy themselves , i ask that you keep in mind that we all have to act professionally and responsibly during and after these events . i have been working with chris calger and amy fitzpatrick to put together some guidelines for company - sponsored social events :
the company will provide soft drinks , beer , and wine . you may choose to order other beverages at your expense .
functions will run for a specified period of time . if there is an open bar , we will establish a time certain after which enron will not pay for any additional drinks .
if you require assisance getting home , please contact a taxi and submit the fare for expense reimbursement with no questions asked . the last thing in the world we want is to have people break the law or put their safety and the safety of others in jeopardy .
let me know if you have any questions . thanks for your cooperation .",ham

our convention is whoever finalizes the model should write the documentation . it does not make sense
to write one when changes are anticipated . you have been working on this almost a year , it never
strikes you that we need a documentation ?
i created exotica . xll , does that also give you an excuse not working on exotica documentation ?

here are the c - codes for the crudeapo . ' sig ' is the spot
volatility meaning the price volatility within the delivery period .
you should consult with pavel for the definition of this "" extra "" parameters . we
would like to see the position monitor once you get it running .
we might have some additional suggestions .
paulo ,
why don ' t we have a documentation on crudeapo you worked on ?
i can not find it in exotica help file . please supply that to tai , thanks .

chris ,
e hired tony to support global markets but jeff shankman decided that , given
highly specialized nature of his work it makes sense to put him in the
research group , with a dotted line to mike roberts who is running our weather
group .
given that his work will directly and exclusively benefit gm , it makes sense
for research to charge his expenses
to global markets . we can adjust allocations to reflect his contributions to
different sub - units of gm .
tony spent the last few weeks in houston training for his position in london
with mike roberts .
we are very excited about the prospect of working with him .

"trastornos del
desarrollo , no están asociados al mercurio de las
vacunas
luego de hacerse una revisión tanto retrospectiva como
prospectiva de la posible asociación del mercurio contenido en las vacunas
con trastornos del desarrollo sicomotor del lactante , y de una revisión
crítica de la literatura publicada en relación a la asociación con
autismo , se concluye que no existe evidencia suficiente de causar algún
efecto deletéreo . tanto las nuevas vacunas en las que solo se pueden
encontrar trazas de mercurio , como en las antiguas que tienen timerosal ,
son seguras , no siendo necesario cambiar el esquema actual de vacunación
ni tampoco en términos de costo - beneficio realizar una investigación más
exhaustiva . contextolos trastornos del
desarrollo atribuidos al mercurio contenido en las vacunas son : trastorno
del desarrollo general , retardo del habla o del lenguaje , tics , trastorno
de déficit de atención , autismo , retardos inespecíficos del desarrollo ,
problemas de comportamiento , encopresis y enuresis . es esencial
conocer en primer lugar las diferentes formas en que se puede encontrar el
mercurio asociado a daño neurológico . el mercurio inorgánico , se conoce ,
tiene riesgo potencial para el neurodesarrollo y de toxicidad renal en
niños pequeños . las formas orgánicas del mercurio son
metil - mercurio y etil - mercurio . la exposición acumulativa a metil - mercurio
( mehg ) , que posee una vida media prolongada y atraviesa la barrera
hematoencefálica , puede producir daño neurológico , al convertirse en
mercurio inorgánico y acumularse , o también puede causar daño
renal . el etil - mercurio contenido en el timerosal , es un compuesto
orgánico , que posee una vida media mucho más corta que la forma metil - , se
excreta en forma rápida por las heces y no atraviesa la barrera
hematoencefálica . el timerosal se usa en el proceso de fabricación de
vacunas no vivas de germen entero como dpt y td , y en la mayoría de las
vacunas de influenza . en las nuevas vacunas , que acogieron la
recomendación de la organización mundial de la salud de eliminar el
timerosal , se pueden encontrar en ellas trazas residuales como resultado
del proceso de esterilización y manufactura . la controversia que se
inició a partir de 1999 y que está a punto de terminar , tomó como dato de
referencia , los derivados de la extrapolación de los resultados obtenidos
con metil - mercurio , que pose una farmacodinamia y farmacocinética
diferente al etil - mercurio contenido en las vacunas . esto es fácil
de inferir al analizar en conjunto los 3 artículos publicados en el número
de septiembre de 2004 en pediatrics . estudios recientesen el
primero de ellos , el doctor jon heron y colegas , estudiaron en forma
prospectiva , una población de 12 . 600 niños habitantes de avon ( reino
unido ) en relación al número de dosis de vacunas recibidas , no encontrando
evidencia de efectos deletéreos al usar un esquema acelerado de vacunas
que contenían etil - mercurio . estas vacunas son similares en los
constituyentes e intervalos de aplicación a las usadas en todos los países
en desarrollo , como parte del programa ampliado de inmunización
( pai ) . en el segundo artículo , el doctor nick andrews y colegas ,
hicieron en el reino unido , una revisión retrospectiva de 9 años ( 1988 -
1997 ) de la cantidad recibida de timerosal contenido en las vacunas de dpt
y dt en los primeros meses de vida , cada una conteniendo 50 mg de
timerosal equivalentes a 25 mg de etil - mercurio y la posibilidad de
trastorno del neurodesarrollo . los autores concluyeron que ha
excepción de los tics presentados en un número pequeño y considerados en
su gran mayoría como eventos transitorios , no existe evidencia que
relacione la exposición al timerosal con trastornos del desarrollo . de
igual forma encontraron los niveles sanguíneos de mercurio en rangos
seguros , lo que reafirma la rápida excreción del etil - mercurio por las
heces . esta evidencia adicional y la no relación de toxicidad del
mercurio en lactantes , niños y adultos expuestos al timerosal contenido en
las vacunas , fueron presentados al who global advisory committee on
vaccine safety , june 2002 . este comité concluyó que no hay razón de
cambiar los esquemas actuales de vacunas , especialmente en los países en
desarrollo , en donde en algunos , son la única opción disponible para
combatir la morbilidad y mortalidad derivadas de las enfermedades
inmunoprevenibles , sobrepasando en forma amplia el riesgo teórico del
etil - mercurio . en el tercer artículo , la doctora sarah k . parker y
colegas , hicieron una revisión crítica de los datos originales obtenidos
de 12 publicaciones que reunieron los criterios de inclusión , y su posible
relación de causa entre trastornos de tipo autista y del neurodesarrollo
con el timerosal contenido en las vacunas . de nuevo , no se demostró
vínculo alguno de causalidad , reafirmando como mayores causas de autismo
las influencias genéticas y los factores prenatales y
postnatales . de igual forma se postula que el reciclaje del
mercurio proveniente de las prácticas industriales puede colocar en riesgo
de exposición no ocupacional a la población , al encontrarse en alimentos
contaminados , como puede ser el caso del atún , en el que una lata de 5 - 6
onzas puede llegar a contener 12 _ g de mercurio . el comité de
revisión de seguridad en inmunización del instituto de medicina , en el
2001 reconsideró que las vacunas estén asociadas como causa de autismo y
rechazó la relación de causalidad entre la vacuna triple viral ( paperas ,
rubéola y sarampión ) y las vacunas que contienen mercurio con el
autismo . conclusiónlos estudios
farmacocinéticos y la evidencia revisada , indican que los niveles
sanguíneos de mercurio post vacunales en lactantes , no alcanzan niveles de
toxicidad , siendo entonces muy poco probable que causen daño
neurológico . el eliminar el mercurio de las vacunas , exige mayores
exigencias en la cadena de frío , lo hace más costoso y en los países de
desarrollo se puede convertir en una importante barrera que conduzca a que
menos niños sean vacunados contra enfermedades mortales inmunoprevenibles ,
disminuyendo su cobertura e incrementando las posibilidades de
epidemias . , 114 ( 3 ) :
