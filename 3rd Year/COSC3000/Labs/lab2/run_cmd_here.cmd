echo off
echo This is a standard command prompt, from which you can run python commands. 
echo It is normally started from the directory containing a lab.
echo To run a lab, do for example:
echo python lab2_template1.py
echo On the lab computers it is important that you give the command "python ??" 
echo explicitly since if you just do for example (or double click):
echo lab2_template1.py
echo it will use the installed Python 2.7 distribution, instead of Python 3.5.
